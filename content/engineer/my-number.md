That's how much of a reduction in COVID spread can be achieved through:

- 6 air changes per hour (ACH) of ventilation + 
- Upper room UVGI + 
- [#CorsiRosenthalBox](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CorsiRosenthalBox)

No mandates required.

Where did that number come from?

**75% reduction in transmission of measles [from upper room UVGI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2789813/).** 25% remains.

**50% reduction in transmission of measles from ventilation/filtration.** 50% of these remain.

{{< tweet user="j_g_allen" id="1491061208468037641" >}}

**25% * 50% of cases remaining = 12.5% total remaining = 87.5 % reduction.**

These methods work better together - better air circulation makes upper room UVGI more effective. CR Box addition mixes air even more and removes all PM2.5, not just virus laden aerosols.

87.5% reduction in COVID transmission from ventilation, filtration and upper room UVGI?! 
Am I too optimistic? 
Too much faith in engineering measures? 

Fine. *Run some RCTs and prove me wrong.*
