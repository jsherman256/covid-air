I'm ranking all the engineering methods to stop COVID based on how effective they are.

We'll start with the worst things you can do...

**1. The worst thing you can do: Fogging/Spraying Disinfectant.** DO NOT DO THIS! The chemicals you spray in the air land on surfaces and are supposed to disinfect them. It's really bad for you and doesn't stop the spread of COVID. Just don't.

**2. Next worst thing is electronic air cleaning.** There's poor evidence it's effective in a real world setting and [it can create harmful byproducts](https://medium.com/open-letter-to-address-the-use-of-electronic-air/no-to-ionizers-plasma-uvpco-bc1570b2fb9b). Dry hydrogen peroxide, photocatalytic oxidation, ionization, plasma, hydroxyl, ozone... Stay away. 

**3. Frequent filter changes.** This is something that costs money and effort, but actually makes filters less effective. ASHRAE recommends against it. Nevertheless, everyone is doing it. You can stop.

**4. Surface cleaning** - this includes shining UV light in the room when it's unoccupied and anything a cleaning company will do. COVID is airborne. Clean the air, not surfaces.

**5. Flushing buildings at night.** This doesn't hurt, but doesn't help and wastes a lot of energy. It should also be stopped.

Most places have 1-2 air changes/hour (ACH). Modern minimums are 3-4 ACH. Good air quality is 4-6+ ACH. Filtration and UV use equivalent ACH (eACH). Same effect for COVID.

Now the 11 best ways to clean the air and prevent the spread of COVID (IMO).

**11. Flushing rooms between occupancies.** If a room will be reoccupied within the next couple of hours, leave the HVAC running. This can help a little. It's not one of the more effective measures, but should still be done.

**10. In duct UV** - this can add 1-3 eACH. UV lights are placed either by the coil or in the supply duct of the air handling unit to inactivate virus particles supplied to the space.

**9. Increasing outdoor air %** - this can add 0.5-5 ACH. It's more difficult supplying higher amounts of outdoor air in cold weather. It uses up energy to heat up or cool down the extra air. Still a helpful tool.

**8. Upgrade the filter in the air handling unit to MERV-13.** This adds 2.5-3 eACH and doesn't use up much more energy. You need to be careful not to affect the heating and cooling, but it's usually not a concern.

The three previous air cleaning methods - in-duct UV, increasing outdoor air % and MERV-13 filters all clean recirculated air. They all take place in the air handling unit and not in the space. I refer to them here as "out of room mitigation"

They are less effective:
- they don't work together. It cleans the same air, so there are diminishing returns.
- if the return air comes from a large area, there's a low amount of virus because of dilution.

Onto the most effective methods:

**7. Humidification.** It's difficult to estimate an equivalent ACH for humidity control. It makes the viruses inactivate faster, deposit faster on surfaces (out of the air) and improves your own immune system. Unfortunately, it's rarely used.

{{< tweet user="joeyfox85" id="1467685395819343872" >}}

**6. Stand-alone UV air purification.** This can add 2-3 eACH per unit. It's UV in a box with a fan. Many of these come with photocatalytic oxidation (bad) or a HEPA filter - which makes them redundant. Once you filter it out, it's gone.

**5. Stand-alone HEPA filter or Corsi Rosenthal Box.** This can add 2-3 eACH per unit. The cheapest consistent way to improve air quality. 

**4. Open windows.** Also open the door and use a fan to push air from the window and out the door. It will be a lot of flow. The main problem is it can't be done when it's cold outside. It's difficult to calculate the exact flow from windows.

**3. Ventilation Improvements.** Good ventilation can provide between 3-6 ACH. All the previously mentioned strategies are inferior to having a building with good ventilation. I can't overstate the importance of investing in upgrading ventilation.

**2. Upper Room UVGI** - the real deal. It can add 12-24 eACH. It reduced measles outbreaks by 75%. If we want to go all out on mitigating airborne spread, [this technology is needed](https://time.com/6143799/covid-19-indoor-air-cleaning/).

**1. Far UV** - I've seen estimates between 10-300+ eACH. This technology isn't widespread yet and still expensive, but [it could be a game changer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08462-z) moving forward.

Vaccines protect you from severe disease.
Rapid tests reduce your exposure to infected and highly infectious people.
Wear a respirator indoors.
Spend more time outdoors. 
Besides that, **DO EVERYTHING!**
