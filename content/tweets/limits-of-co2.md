To start by explaining what CO2 monitoring does, the outdoor air is just above 400 parts per million (ppm) of CO2, or 0.04%. Human exhaled air can range, but is around 40000 ppm or 4% CO2.

The higher the CO2 levels in indoor air, the more you are rebreathing from other people. There's no official level of what is good CO2 or bad CO2, but commonly used limits of achievable goals of good air quality are 800-1000 ppm.

CO2 levels can be used as a proxy for ventilation levels when in a fully occupied room for long periods (significant caveats there that I'll explain). [ASHRAE has listed](https://twitter.com/WBahnfleth/status/1501232759469391874) many of these in their CO2 guidance.

[@WBahnfleth](https://twitter.com/WBahnfleth) explains one of the main limitations here:

Areas with higher CO2 are associated with sick building syndrome. This includes: poorer concentration, sleepiness, headaches...It's not certain if it's causation or correlation (ASHRAE document).

Assessing risk of spread of airborne diseases is different. [Here's why](https://www.ashrae.org/file%20library/about/position%20documents/pd_indoorcarbondioxide_2022.pdf):

>**2.2 Health and Cognitive Effects of CO2 Exposure**

>Indoor concentrations of CO2 greater than 1000 ppmv have been associated with increases in self-reported, nonspecific symptoms commonly referred to as sick building syndrome (SBS) symptoms. However, these observations were not controlled for other contaminants or environmental parameters; therefore, elevated CO2 concentrations likely served as indicators of inadequate ventilation that increased the concentrations of all contaminants with indoor sources. More recently, several groups have explored the cognitive effects of short-term exposure (2 to 8 h) to pure CO2 at concentrations between 600 and 5000 ppmv. Some of these studies demonstrated concentration-dependent impairment, an indicator of a causal effect, but other studies did not show any effects on cognition. These inconsistencies require further investigation, including study of the mechanisms involved. This research is a priority due to the ubiquity of indoor concentrations of CO2 in excess of 1000 ppmv.

### 1. Occupancy
**A thought experiment:** You go to a spin class in the summer of 2020 and follow all public health guidelines including sanitizing and safe physical distancing, yet somehow [there is a super-spreader event and everyone is shocked](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/spinco-member-shocked-covid-19-1.5763114). ðŸ˜²

A member of team [#COVIDisAirborne](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVIDisAirborne) planted a CO2 monitor and finds out it was at 2500 ppm. Easy to solve this problem.

But rerun the experiment with only half the people there, including the infectious person that was the source. What happens?

Everyone else there still gets sick, but CO2 levels will be much lower. Might be closer to 1500 ppm. That's because to get infected, it's how much of the infectious person's breath you are breathing in, not everyone's.

This is why if there is lower capacity, low CO2 doesn't mean good ventilation.

### 2. Unoccupied CO2 levels
I've seen people posting about good CO2 levels in empty rooms. CO2 comes from people. Once the people leave the room, CO2 levels drop.

They drop from either mechanical ventilation flushing the space or from infiltration - outdoor air naturally entering the space. This tells you nothing about the ventilation when the space is at capacity.

### 3. Time
I was at a weekday synagogue service (I don't carry CO2 monitors on ShabbatðŸ˜€). Gigantic room, about 20% capacity, 1.5 hours long. CO2 started around 700 ppm and went up to 1100 ppm over the service. 1100 is still not extremely high. My suspicion... no ventilation. I couldn't hear it on either. It takes a while for the air in the room to circulate through peoples lungs. After a couple more hours, it would be much higher.

### 4. Aerosol to CO2 ratio
Coughing produces about 1000x more aerosols than breathing, but not that much more CO2. The risk of infection is related to the aerosol concentration which can significantly vary from the CO2 concentration depending on the activity.

### 5. Other factors reduce risk
Ventilation is one of a list of measures to reduce risk. Levels of filtration, masking and types of masks, vaccination status and community prevalence are all other factors that contribute to risk.

### To summarize: 
1. Bad CO2 indicates bad ventilation. Good CO2 doesn't always mean good ventilation.
2. CO2 is not a perfect gauge of aerosol concentration.
3. Ventilation is important, but it is one of multiple measures that is used. It's not the only gauge of risk.
