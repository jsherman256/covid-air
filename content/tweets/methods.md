**Ventilation** - Exchanging indoor air with outdoor air (slight oversimplification)

**Filtration** - passing air through a filter

**Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI)** - kill or inactivate microorganisms with UV light.

**Electronic Air Cleaning (EAC)** - charge particles and discharge them into the space.

They all do different things with different types of indoor pollutants. There are many pollutants, but I'll deal with 3 types:

- Gasses - carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, radon
- Particulate Matter (PM) - dust, smoke, pollen
- Microbes (type of PM) - Viruses, Bacteria, Mold

## Ventilation

It removes indoor gasses, microbes and particulate matter. Mechanical ventilation includes filtration. Natural ventilation (eg. windows) doesn't have filtration and could bring in outdoor pollution.

## Filtration

It removes particulate matter from the air. Efficient filters (HEPA, MERV-13) can remove viruses and bacteria. Less efficient filters (MERV-8) removes dust and pollen. It does nothing for gasses.

## UVGI

It kills microbes. It can kill viruses at a higher rate than ventilation or filtration. It does nothing for gases or particulate matter (besides microbes).

## EAC

Poor evidence of effectiveness. It can [create harmful chemical compounds](https://medium.com/open-letter-to-address-the-use-of-electronic-air/no-to-ionizers-plasma-uvpco-bc1570b2fb9b). Not all electronic air cleaners discharge charged particles, although many do.

![Overview of Electronic Air Cleaning Equipment: Electronic air cleaning equipment includes a variety of electrically powered air-cleaning devices intended to remove particles from airstreams or to inactivate pathogens. The widely used removal mechanisms occur by electrically charging particles using corona wires, pins or needles, with plasma (positive and/or negative ions formed by charging major components of air as well as pollutant molecules), or by photocatalytic oxidation. The design of the system may create one or more reactive oxygen species (ROS), ozone, hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anions, gaseous hydrogen peroxide, and others](/EAC.jpg)

## Summary

- Avoid EAC
- The rest all work against viruses.
- Ventilation is the most important. 
- UVGI is very good for microbes but not other pollutants.
- Filtration still important. Normally, with good ventilation, extra filtration not required.
