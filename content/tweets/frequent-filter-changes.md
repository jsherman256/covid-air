This was [the advice from the Ontario government](https://www.ontario.ca/document/covid-19-health-safety-and-operational-guidance-schools-2021-2022/ventilation).

>For schools with full mechanical ventilation, school boards are expected to:
>- use the highest-grade filters possible, preferably MERV 13 filters
>- undertake frequent filter changes through the school year
>- operate ventilation systems 2 hours or more before and after school occupancy
>- calibrate HVAC systems for maximum air flow and increased fresh air intake

Why?

As time goes on, filters become dirtier and restrict the airflow.

This leads to less ventilation to the space, so changing the filters more often makes sense.

Changing filters more often is also simple. It doesn't require any serious planning, investments, structural changes, new equipment...it's just updating the frequency of something you are doing already. It's extra business for maintenance companies so they'll recommend it.

However, as filters get dirty, they do a better job at trapping virus laden aerosols. Even though the airflow reduces, they become more efficient. Better filters can also handle more dust before restricting airflow significantly.

The difference in airflow over the filter change period isn't significant and for variable volume systems, the fan compensates for the increased pressure drop across the filter, so there's no reduction in flow. At best, there might be minimal energy savings.

So for COVID, ASHRAE [recommends](https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/filtration-disinfection) LESS FILTER CHANGES!!!

>Consider letting the filter load up further than usual to reduce frequency of filter changes.
>- Donâ€™t let pressure drop increase enough to disrupt room pressure differentials
>- Confirm filters are snug in their frames, preferably with gaskets to prevent filter bypass

It's not a typo. They confirm it in [the FAQ on this page](https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/filtration-and-disinfection-faq).

Before investigating this, I would have thought that frequent changes are a little helpful, but not significant. But that's why you do research and find out it's a waste of money that could be spent on things that work.
