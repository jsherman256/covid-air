This is one of the biggest challenges in mitigating COVID transmission. Here are the things you can do.

**1. Respirators**

These are still the best method we have to mitigate the spread of COVID.

**2. Distance (obviously)**

This has been one of the key messages this pandemic. It helps with short-range but doesn't help with shared room transmission.

**3. Plexiglass**

One of the cases where it can help with short range transmission, but make shared-room transmission worse. Only use in specific circumstances.

Need some caveats before the next methods. They are not legitimate replacements for respirators. If you are in unmasked close contact, there is only so much air cleaning technology can do.

There are ways to try to remove the air from the breathing zone quickly before the susceptible person breathes it in. You also need to clean the air once it's removed. Some of these methods have studies, some is a bit of speculation. These are my thoughts.

**4. Airborne Infectious Isolation Rooms**

You control the flow through the room. The air gets pulled out of the breathing zone and exhausted right away protecting susceptible people inside.

Airplanes have a similar concept. Coughing on someone next to you (18" / 45 cm away) is equivalent to around 2 m or 6 ft distance without the ventilation. That's a significant reduction in risk, even though it's far from eliminated.

**5. Aerosol extractor**

It's a flexible ducted intake to a HEPA filter. You put the hose near the person's mouth and it sucks the aerosols in before the other person breathes it in. I've seen this at the dentist.

**6. Ceiling Fans**

These fans can either create currents to pull the air up out of the breathing zone or push air down into the breathing zone. These work well in rooms with high ceilings. It can help in crowded places too.

![Diagram showing the air currents created by a ceiling fan. The fan tends to move air upwards and away from itself](/ceiling-fan.png)

They also help in general to save energy. In the summer when it's hot, they promote evaporative cooling on your skin requiring less mechanical cooling.

In the winter they can push hot air that is buoyant in the upper room into the lower room (destratification).

Bringing air into the upper room in places with high ceilings lowers risk in general. Combining it with upper room UV will do a great job at cleaning the air.

**7. Displacement Ventilation**

Displacement ventilation is very rare in Canada. The vast majority of mechanically ventilated buildings are mixing ventilation. In mixing ventilation, the air is usually both supplied and returned from the ceiling.

For mixing ventilation, we assume the room is well mixed, so things that mix the air in the room like HEPA filters aren't detrimental.

Displacement ventilation is different. Slightly cooler air is supplied near the floor and extracted at the ceiling.

![Diagram comparing traditional mixing and displacement ventilation. In the former, air is mostly homogenous. In the latter, older air moves upwards, away from occupants](/displacement-ventilation.jpg)

This creates an upward current through the room. I can't say how effective this would be for short range mitigation. The airflow speed is not that high. The air can then be exhausted or filtered in the HVAC unit before being resupplied.

**8. Use a fan for cross-current (beware)**

You can have a fan blowing air between two people out of the breathing zone, reducing the amount of shared air you breathe in at short range. You'll be putting anyone downstream at risk. 

If it's a confined, poorly ventilated space, you'll be blowing the aerosols around and it won't protect anyone from shared-room transmission, so you need to clean the air with ventilation, filtration or UV.

**9. Far UV (maybe)**

This is UV light that is safe enough to shine directly at people, but can still kill viruses. Can't be certain how effective it will be, but when you have very high air change rates, I suspect it might help to some extent.

**10. General air quality improvement**

Good air quality helps with short range transmission. It isn't something you can rely on solely, but [it can make a difference](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ina.12946)

Outdoor is lowest risk, sufficient ventilation is low risk, and poor ventilation is high risk. The benefits of ventilation are more pronounced as distance increases, especially over 2 meters](/inhalation-risk.jpg)

Airborne diseases transmit best at close range. [Here's what the CDC says about TB.](https://www.cdc.gov/tb/education/corecurr/pdf/chapter2.pdf)

We know that ventilation and upper room UV reduce transmission of TB. They work against COVID too.
