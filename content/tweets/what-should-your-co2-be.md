summary: If you intend to speak up when CO2 levels are too high, you need to know when that happens. Here, a ventilation expert claims classrooms should be around 1500 ppm. Is that correct? What should it really be?

Here, [a ventilation expert claims](https://twitter.com/mjb302/status/1433721407423328276) classrooms should be around 1500 ppm. Is that correct? What should it really be?

It's takes three steps:

### Step 1: Find out what your ventilation should be. 

You have to calculate it as shown in [this thread](https://twitter.com/joeyfox85/status/1542959661829312512).

For a classroom, I'll assume 800 sq ft and 25 people.

The ventilation should be:
```
10 x 25 + 0.12 x 800 = 346 cubic feet/minute (CFM)
```
or
``` 
5 x 25 + 0.6 x 74.3 sq m = 169 Litres/second (lps)
```

### Step 2: Find the ventilation per person. 

Divide the answer in step 1 by the number of people:

```
Ventilation/person = 346 CFM/25 = 13.8 CFM/person
```
or 
```
169 lps/25 = 6.8 lps/person
```

### Step 3: Look it up in this table

||Low activity adults||High activity adults||Low activity children||High activity children||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**COâ‚‚  (ppm)**|**LPS**|**CFM**|**LPS**|**CFM**|**LPS**|**CFM**|**LPS**|**CFM**|
|**600**|30.0|63.3|85.6|180.5|19.4|41.0|55.6|117.2|
|**700**|19.3|40.7|55.0|116.1|12.5|26.4|35.7|75.4|
|**800**|14.2|30.0|40.5|85.5|9.2|19.4|26.3|55.5|
|**900**|11.3|23.7|32.1|67.7|7.3|15.4|20.8|44.0|
|**1000**|9.3|19.6|26.6|56.0|6.0|12.7|17.2|36.4|
|**1100**|7.9|16.8|22.6|47.8|5.1|10.9|14.7|31.0|
|**1200**|6.9|14.6|19.7|41.7|4.5|9.5|12.8|27.1|
|**1300**|6.1|12.9|17.5|36.9|4.0|8.4|11.4|24.0|
|**1400**|5.5|11.6|15.7|33.2|3.6|7.5|10.2|21.5|
|**1500**|5.0|10.6|14.3|30.1|3.2|6.8|9.3|19.5|
|**1600**|4.6|9.7|13.1|27.5|3.0|6.3|8.5|17.9|
|**1700**|4.2|8.9|12.0|25.4|2.7|5.8|7.8|16.5|
|**1800**|3.9|8.3|11.2|23.5|2.5|5.4|7.2|15.3|
|**1900**|3.6|7.7|10.4|22.0|2.4|5.0|6.8|14.3|
|**2000**|3.4|7.2|9.7|20.6|2.2|4.7|6.3|13.4|
|**2200**|3.0|6.4|8.7|18.3|2.0|4.1|5.6|11.9|
|**2400**|2.7|5.8|7.8|16.4|1.8|3.7|5.1|10.7|
|**2600**|2.5|5.2|7.1|14.9|1.6|3.4|4.6|9.7|
|**2800**|2.3|4.8|6.5|13.7|1.5|3.1|4.2|8.9|
|**3000**|2.1|4.4|6.0|12.6|1.4|2.9|3.9|8.2|
|**3200**|1.9|4.1|5.5|11.7|1.3|2.7|3.6|7.6|
|**3400**|1.8|3.8|5.2|10.9|1.2|2.5|3.4|7.1|

For this case, 13.8 CFM/person or 6.8 lps/person for kids puts you around 950 ppm. If you are in a classroom and your average CO2 is much higher than 1000 ppm, it's likely is not complying with modern ASHRAE ventilation requirements.

We can also do this the long way. Kids sitting at desks is [around 1.3 Met](/tweets/calculating-ventilation-from-co2/). This translates to [0.0033 lps of CO2 for elementary and 0.0045 lps for high school](/tweets/calculating-ventilation-from-co2/).

|![Chart listing metabolic rates for various activities. Available in text form in the previous link](/metabolic-sitting.png)|![Large chart showing CO2 generation rates based on age, sex and metabolic rates](/co2-elementary.png)|

Elementary:
`420 + 0.0033*1000000/6.8 = 905 ppm`

High School:
`420 + 0.0045*1000000/6.8 = 1081 ppm`

Well below 1500 ppm quoted earlier.

Note: I dealt with mechanical ventilation in this thread. Natural ventilation is slightly higher. Still well below 1500 ppm.
