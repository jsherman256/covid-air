To start with a quick recap, risk of getting infected is based on number of breaths and virus concentration. Number of breaths is breathing rate and time.

The virus concentration is about how much is generated (# of infected people and activity) and how much is removed (ventilation + filtration + UV + decay + deposition).

Here's how room size can affect the virus concentration:

3/10

1. Ventilation - Larger rooms require more airflow and ventilation. Even if it's not up to modern minimum requirements, it's generally true to say there is more total ventilation in larger rooms. This is the biggest difference between large and small rooms.

2. Transient state or reservoir effect - you start out with no virus in the space and as time goes on, the concentration builds up. This is called the transient state.

5/10

Eventually, the concentration will get high enough that the amount being generated equals the amount being removed. This is called the steady state.

6/10

In this plot, you can see that the smaller room reaches the steady state (horizontal line) quicker. The amount of virus breathed in is the concentration x time or the area under the curve. The yellow area is the virus you don't inhale in the larger room.

3. Decay - Virus decay is related to the time after it's exhaled. In a larger room with the same ventilation level, the concentration of virus is the same, but it takes longer on average to breathe in, so you'll be breathing in more decayed virus which can't infect you.

8/10

4. Deposition - When the virus lands on a surface, it's not in the air and you won't breathe it in. This depends on the area and volume of the room. The article shows the effect is increased in a room with a larger area.

9/10

There are many factors that can increase or decrease risk including # of people, distancing, masking and activities. But all else being equal, a larger room is lower risk for contracting COVID than a small room.
