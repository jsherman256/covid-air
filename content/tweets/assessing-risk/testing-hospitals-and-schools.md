There are many factors that contribute to risk. PPE is one of them. Saying "you don't need N95s" means "your risk is sufficiently low that a N95 isn't necessary". Testing centers used surgical masks, so weren't they good enough?

2/9

It's definitely a significant risk to interact with many COVID + patients and I'm not trying to diminish that, but there are a lot of things that reduced risk at testing centers:
1. Patients wore masks
2. Good ventilation
3. Most importantly - very short interaction time.

3/9

Getting infected is about the inhaled dose. It's related to virus concentration and time. When I had to get myself or kids tested, the doctor was in the room with us for 1-2 minutes maximum. Very short interaction time + level 3 surgical mask + good ventilation = low risk

4/9

The situation at testing centers doesn't apply to other situations. Schools and workplaces:
Poor masking + Poor ventilation +8 hours a day = much higher risk. 

As far as hospital transmission, there were attempts to cover it up.

Hospitals have a lot going for them: good ventilation, trained medical professionals who can wear PPE and teams devoted to infection prevention & control (IPAC). Yet they failed miserably. The rest of us had to follow their abysmal standards.

We shouldn't forget what happened. Ontario nurses had to sue to try to get access to proper PPE. Powerful doctors in hospitals forcibly restricted nurses from accessing N95s.

They needlessly endangered vulnerable people. It didn't have to happen.

Many school boards, work places and medical centers prohibited or disciplined people who wanted to wear respirators. All because IPAC and public health didn't understand how this virus spread, how to assess risk and abused their power.
