- Close contact
- Confined with poor ventilation.
- Crowded places

These do a good job at summarizing risk factors.

The goal is to simplify the message, but here's a deeper dive at why these scenarios are high risk for COVID transmission.

COVID transmits primarily indoors either at close range or when sharing a space for extended periods with poor air quality.

Transmission can happen long-range or outdoors, but is not as high risk.

We'll look at the 3 C's and see which factors cause risk to increase in those situations.

1. Close contact

This one is straightforward. We know that to get infected you need to inhale an infectious dose. The aerosols you emit are concentrated in front of your face initially. That's why there is lots of short-range transmission.

2. Confined with poor ventilation

There are 2 factors main here:
1. Air quality measures
2. Room size

Both of these factors allow the virus concentration in the air to increase quickly and remain high.

Room size:

3. Crowded spaces

These spaces can be very high risk for many reasons. Here are the factors that affect risk there:
a. Number of people
b. Distance
c. Aerosol generation
d. Time
e. Ventilation

7/13

Number of people - The more people, the more likely to encounter infectious people. High community rates make this inevitable.

Distance - You can't distance when people are crammed together.

8/13

Aerosol generation - crowded places have high background noise causing people to talk loudly. The creates higher aerosol generation increasing risk of infection.

9/13

Time - this doesn't always hold, but often these venues are places where both the infectious person and the susceptible person are there for extended periods of time. It allows virus concentrations to get high and increases the dose you are inhaling.

10/13

Ventilation - certain areas have high occupant density and very poor outdoor air per person. Remember the White House dinner with CO2 levels > 2000 ppm? I calculated it - it's completely inline with ASHRAE standards. 

11/13

When there are high community rates, current standard ventilation is not effective at those types of venues. You would need to significantly increase the ventilation or use filtration or UV to help mitigate airborne diseases. 

12/13

The 3 C's are a good guideline to avoid places at high risk of short range and shared room airborne transmission. It's also good to know why.
