First, a quick recap from the last thread. Getting infected is primarily about number of breaths x virus concentration. More time and higher breathing rate leads to more breaths. Concentration is higher at short range.

2/19

But what affects the virus concentration in a room? The steady-state concentration is proportional to the ratio of the rate of emission to the rate of removal. 

3/19


Simply, if you double the rate of virus being emitted, you double the final concentration. If you double the rate it's removed, the concentration gets cut in half. Here's the formula:

Concentration = Rate of emission/Rate of removal.

So what defines these two rates?

4/19

Rate of emission is related to a few factors: how many infected people there are, their viral load and what activities they are doing. So,

Rate of emission = # infected ppl x viral load x activity

5/19

Factors that effect rate of emission:
1. The risk from # of infected ppl is related to the community prevalence and the # of ppl there. More infected people in the community and larger gatherings means higher chance of having more infected people in a space.

6/19

2. Viral load varies over the course of the illness. People are initially more infectious and over the course of illness, they become less infectious. This will be relevant when discussing risk in hospitals in a future thread.

3. Aerosol emission is highly dependent on the activity. Breathing, talking, singing, exercising all have significant differences. "High-risk settings" usually means settings with high emission activities and poor removal mechanisms.

8/19

The next question is what factors lower the viral concentration in the space? There are 4 mechanisms to remove the virus:

Ventilation, filtration, deactivation and deposition.

9/19

Ventilation is replacing the air in the space with clean air. It can be natural (open windows) or mechanical (HVAC).

Filtration is passing the air through a filter and removing the virus laden aerosols. It can be in the space (HEPA filter/CR box) or in the HVAC unit.

10/19

Deactivation is the viruses no longer being able to infect you. It can happen naturally through decay or it can be done actively with UV light. Natural decay rate is dependent on temperature and humidity. There are many ways UV is used.

11/19

Deposition is the virus laden aerosol landing on a surface so it's not in the air and you won't breathe it in. The rate is related to the humidity and the surface area of the space. Low humidity causes droplets to evaporate and become aerosols instead of depositing. 

12/19

If the space is well-mixed, these measures are additive. Usually, ventilation is the most significant factor. Most places don’t have filtration or UV. Back of envelope - I estimate the effect of deposition and decay is about 25% of ventilation.

It's the absolute value you care about for the mitigation measures. Air changes per hour (ACH) measures the flow per volume of the room. CO2 measures the flow per person, but you care about total flow. You need the right metric.

We can add distance to the list as well. At close range concentration is high and reduces to a constant value around 2 m. This is dependent on the removal mechanisms.

One last factor is masking. Whatever the concentration in the room is, the masks remove a certain percent. The final concentration you inhale is the amount that leaks through.

16/19

Putting it together, here's the virus concentration formula and risk formula:

This formula is very similar to the I just derived.
In this formula they use air changes per hour (ACH) x volume which is just the total flow.

One last caveat is this is the steady-state concentration. A room starts empty and then the virus concentration increases until it reaches steady-state. Understanding how these factors vary in different spaces requires more threads. They will be coming out soon.
