To assess the risk of a space, first you need to know how you get infected and what contributes to it. I'll spend a few threads going into detail about the factors. Here's the first one.

2/13

The primary way you get infected with COVID is by inhaling an infectious dose over a certain period of time. The dose is defined by 4 factors:
Dose = Virus concentration x time x breathing rate x respiratory tract deposition rate

Dose is related to the probability of infection. You can still get infected with a low dose (like outdoors), it's just lower probability. That's why it's problematic to say something is "safe". Lowering the dose reduces risk of infection, but doesn't eliminate risk.

Breakdown of the factors

Time - the longer you spend exposed to a certain concentration, the higher the risk. For activities that don't require spending extended periods of time, like going to a store, minimizing time is an effective measure to reduce risk.

5/13

Breathing rate - For some reason the "hold your breath" method hasn't been promoted enough ðŸ¤”. When breathing rate is 0, you don't get infected through inhalation. (For the trolls reading this, incase you couldn't tell, it's a joke).

6/13

The faster you are breathing, the more air you inhale over a period of time. Putting time and breathing rate together, the risk is related to the number of breaths you've taken. More breaths means higher risk.

7/13

Deposition rate - Many of the virus particles you inhale do not stay inside you, you just breathe them back out. Only the ones that deposit inside you can infect you. However, I don't think this is relevant for assessing risk. (I'll QT if experts disagree at the end.)

8/13

One possible exception is you have innate immunity and it can remove particles that have deposited instead of them infecting you. Exposure to low humidity inhibits this and increases the risk from deposition. Run a humidifier when it's dry inside.

9/13

Virus concentration - The final and most complicated factor. The higher the concentration you inhale, the fewer breaths required to reach an infectious dose. So how do you assess virus concentration?

10/13

Range - initially when you exhale, there is a jet of concentrated air in front of you (think of a smoker breathing out or smelling someone's breath). The virus concentration is highest at short range from the source. That's why infection risk is highest in close contact.

11/13

However, the majority of air you breathe in at short range isn't actually from that person's breath. Most of the air is still from the room, so low virus concentrations in the rest of the room make a difference - even at short range.

12/13

After the short range jet, the virus laden aerosols in the air then diffuse into the room. There are many factors that affect the final virus concentration and they're important for assessing risk. That will be the next thread.
