First, it's important to know the factors that contribute to risk. See the thread below.

The simplest way to use the graph is to pick a line that defines your risk tolerance and adjust the gathering size based on population prevalence.

Another thing you can do is adjust your masking based on the probability of encountering an infected person.

You can stay only in large, well-ventilated spaces or limit your time at gatherings as the probability encountering an infected person increases.

3/5

You can also use the graph to determine when you will only gather outdoors.

You can choose to only gather with vaccinated or recently recovered people based on population prevalence and the effectiveness of their previous immunity (or your immunity).

4/5

This is an issue of understanding risk, ways of mitigating risk, your risk tolerance and taking the steps inline with your values.
