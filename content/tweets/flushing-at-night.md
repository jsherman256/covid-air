Just think of smoke. Imagine the infected person was smoking in the room and now you walk in, how much smoke are you inhaling?

What's the ventilation and filtration like in the room? Good air quality measures could clear out the virus.

**1. What were they doing in the room?**

Singing and shouting or running on a treadmill creates more aerosols than sitting and reading while wearing a mask.

**2. How long were they there?**
Briefly in and out doesn't leave a lot of virus instead of being there for a long time.

**3. How long since they were there last?**

All these factors define the risk. So what can you do?

ASHRAE recommends leaving the HVAC units running for **3 air changes** after occupancy ends (this reduces any virus particles by 95%).

So if a person with COVID is in a room and coughs lots of virus into the space, then then they leave the space, the HVAC system turns off (no flushing) and the virus particles linger. Someone walks in 20 minutes later and breathes in enough virus particles to get infected.

But if the HVAC system stayed on, virus removed, no infection.

This might be true if the room is unoccupied for less than an hour or so, possibly more, but...

What happens if the HVAC system turns off over night without flushing and no one is in the building for 8 hours?

**1. Virus particles decay**

This depends on temperature & humidity, but the half life is about 1-2 hours.

**2. Natural ventilation** 

Natural ventilation through infiltration and exfiltration. Buildings aren't air tight, there's always some leakage - generally around 0.5 air changes/hour or more.

**3. Depositing**

Aerosols deposit on surfaces just like dust deposits on surfaces. If it isn't in the air, you won't breathe it in.

Point is, the risk is negligible that someone will get COVID in a room that hasn't had someone in it for 8 hours, even with the HVAC system off.

Some zones are controlled by a motion sensor. If there's occupancy, the HVAC unit turns on and if not, it turns off. It makes sense to stop this during COVID. During occupied hours, the system should stay on in case someone left virus laden aerosols in the air.

But once occupancy is over for the day, I think there is minimal benefit in flushing the building when there's 8 hours or more before the next occupancy. It also wastes a lot of energy. 

IMHO, flushing buildings at night doesn't help. Leaving HVAC running during the day might have helped in a small amount of cases, but hasn't made a significant impact compared to outdoor events, HEPA filters and ventilation upgrades. (Still should be done)

But it's easy to implement this measure - it just requires adjusting schedules and no meaningful improvements to the ventilation system, so it is favored by many organizations despite the fact that it's energy intensive.

Note: If it wasn’t clear - unoccupied means everyone is out of the building. When there are a few people there like an end of day cleaning service, it’s still occupied.
