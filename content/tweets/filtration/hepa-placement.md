1. Best to have one that blows air up
2. If blowing sideways, best not to aim it at anyone. 
3. If it’s in the direction of someone, keep at least 2m (6’) away 
4. Centre of the room is best
5. Don’t blow into a wall or object
6. Raised is better than on the floor
7. Give at least 0.5 m (1.5’) clearance from walls or objects that could restrict flow
8. Keep away from other sources of clean air: open windows, supply air vents, other HEPA filters
9. If you have multiple, space them out.
10. Make sure there’s no obstruction to where the air is going (like under a table)
11. In classrooms, there’s usually plenty of room at the front. 
12. Sometimes it’s better to move it a bit away from people if it allows you to run it on a higher speed because of noise
