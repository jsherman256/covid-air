If the space is so big, it will be cleaning such a small fraction of the air, so will it actually help?

**The answer is: YES!!!**

It's just as helpful, or even more helpful than in a small room.

The risk of getting infected is based on the concentration of the virus in the air. For a pollutant like CO2, the final concentration has nothing to do with room size. It's only related to the rate which CO2 is produced and the rate it is removed.

For viruses, bigger rooms are lower risk for multiple reasons:

### 1. Transient state
It takes longer for the room to fill up with virus particles

### 2. Decay
The same concentration of virus particles over a larger volume will have more decay before you breathe it in.

### 3. Deposition
Larger rooms have more surface area for viruses to deposit.

I expand on these three items [here](https://twitter.com/joeyfox85/status/1539765545444196353).

But the point is, the room size doesn't affect the virus concentration - it's the removal rate.

A HEPA filter would leave the same final concentration in a room independent of the ceiling height. (Ignoring decay and deposition).

But wait - it gets better. One of the issues with rooms with high ceilings is ensuring the air is properly mixed between the upper and lower rooms. The upper room provides a reservoir of clean air, so how do you get clean air to come down?

The best way to do this is with ceiling fans, but you know another way? Use a HEPA filter or CR Box that blows up. For every unit of air that crosses from the lower room into the upper room, air from the upper room needs to go into the lower room.

I'll need to say this over and over and over: As long as you don't create a cross-breeze between people, mixing the air in the room with a fan/HEPA filter/CR Box is a good thing.

### So how do you size a HEPA filter? 

If you are calculating the size based on flow per person, then room size makes no difference.

If you are calculating by room size (air changes per hour), I wouldn't actually calculate the volume. Assume a ceiling height of 2.7 m or 9'.

So a typical classroom is 75 square meters area and 2.7 m ceiling `= 200 m^3`. 
You want `6 ACH = 6x200 = 1200 m^3/h = 333 litres/second (lps)`

If you have another classroom with 4 m ceilings, pretend it's 2.7 m and stick with 333 lps.
