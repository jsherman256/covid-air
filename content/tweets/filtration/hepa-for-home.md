This does not provide fresh air. Ventilation is required for that. Here are some things to consider:

WHAT IS YOUR GOAL?

Do you just want to improve the air quality in your house in general or do you want to have a gathering and use the HEPA filter to mitigate risk of COVID transmission? The clean air delivery rate (CADR) for these two goals is very different.

2/10

For basic air quality improvement, go here: https://ashrae.org/technical-resources/standards-and-guidelines

Click on standard 62.2-2019. Top of page 8 has a table based on house size.

Consider poor air mixing between rooms. Ex - your bedroom door is closed. HEPA filter outside won't help.

3/10

MITIGATING COVID SPREAD

Note: this reduces risk, but not a guarantee against transmission.

Imagine COVID leaving someone's mouth like invisible second hand smoke.

The HEPA filter does the opposite, it sucks in that smoke and puts out clean air. 

4/10

If a HEPA filter is in one room and you and someone else are in a different room, it won't do much good. You need to be breathing in the filtered air.

How much is necessary? I can't say with certainty, but old ASHRAE guidelines for smoking lounges are 60 CFM/person.

5/10

Old guidelines for smoking areas in casinos and restaurants were 30 CFM/person with a note "supplementary smoke-removal equipment may be required".

If you are relying on ventilation and filtration to mitigate spread, distancing is very important.

COVID isn't smoke. I don't know the necessary CADR, but this provides a basis for comparison. 

BEDROOMS

Another thing to consider - if you want clean air while you sleep, then it's much better to have a HEPA filter in your bedroom. A smaller one will be sufficient.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

I've discussed guidelines on finding the CADR. These are a minimum. Nothing wrong with more. The other considerations are cost and noise (avoid ionization). For your bedroom, you'd want it very quiet. Here's a comparison:

 There is a middle of the road option between minimum residential ventilation and COVID mitigation. You can use the sizing advertised with the HEPA filter. That should give > 4ACH - good air quality.

Or you can calculate it yourself:

What do I do?

#corsirosenthalbox ! A large one for the main floor and mini CR boxes for the bedrooms. Run them all on low.
