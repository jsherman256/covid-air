When to use:
- large CR box is a bit loud for sleeping, so these are better for bedrooms
- try to sneak these in to places where HEPA filters are banned. No one will have a clue what they are.

4/6

Because of the shape of the back of the fan, the cardboard needs to be put at the bottom and the filter opposite the fan.

The filters need to be assembled in a slightly different configuration. Try to fit them around and use duct tape to cover the gaps.

Admittedly, for small applications like a bedroom, a standard tiny HEPA filter from the store is sufficient and not too expensive. But if you are having a gathering, you can turn these up and get pretty good CADR for the cost.
