### 1. Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) in CFM or m^3/h

For CADR, the info should come with the filter, but you might be able to confirm it here: https://ahamdir.com/room-air-cleaners/

The standard conversion between CADR to room size: 
`sq ft = CADR (in CFM) x 1.55`

Be wary. Some products just make up sq ft. 
Double check the CADR.

### 2. Noise in dB

||
|-|
|<50 dB = 😀|
|51-55 dB = 🙂|
|56-60 dB = 😐|
|61-65 dB = ☹️|
|\>65 dB = 😡|


### 3. Cost $

No benefit in more expensive ones. Use a reputable brand, size it properly and make sure it isn't noisy. Expensive ones are usually a waste. Standard ones at the hardware store are usually fine. 

### 4. Extra stuff like UV/ionizers

UV-C doesn't help if there's a HEPA. No need.
[Avoid ionizers](https://medium.com/open-letter-to-address-the-use-of-electronic-air/no-to-ionizers-plasma-uvpco-bc1570b2fb9b), UV PCO and any other fancy technologies.
Make sure it's real HEPA and not "HEPA like" or along those lines.
