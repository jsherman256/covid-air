First, call up the teacher, principal, superintendent, trustee and tell them about these. Recommending that the kids build them themselves in science class might help. You'll definitely get resistance though, here are some counter arguments:

2/13

ALREADY HAVE A HEPA FILTER

What HEPA filters they are using? Are they run on high (probably not)? What's the CADR? They aren't going to do anything meaningful. At least ask that they be run on high speed and if not, they need more filtration.

VENTILATION MEETS STANDARDS

How much ACH? Minimum standards aren't good enough. We need to do everything possible. Older buildings can have poor ventilation and the more air filtered/ventilated the lower the risk.

SAFETY

EPA Reviewed as being safe:

Concern about fingers into fan. Hurricane and For Living have smaller gaps than Lasko. You can also incorporate a metal mesh:

Use hand protection against papercuts with cardboard.

![I built a #corsirosenthalbox and my 6 yo tried to stick her finger in. I put a 1/4”x1/4” mesh on top. Now it’s child proof. This might be something to consider when putting them in schools.

PROFESSIONAL APPROVAL

Straight from the chair of the ASHRAE Epidemic Task Force:

MONEY/EQUITY

Hard argument to refute. Probably the only way to deal with this is trying to raise money for this. It's not right that they would prevent some places from having it if all places can't, but that might be board policy. Might be possible at the school level.

7/13

EFFECTIVENESS

CR boxes when run on low speed are quieter and filter more air than some of the best HEPA filters on high speed. IMHO, they are a better option for classrooms than HEPA filters.

GENERAL RESISTANCE

If your kid is in a public school, I fear this will be a real uphill battle. Boards need to set general policies across all schools. They have followed public health who continue to refuse admitting that #COVIDisAirborne .

11/13

Some school boards have put HEPA filters in each classroom, even though they aren't being run properly. Many school boards across Canada still ban HEPA filters and respirators. This is a disaster caused by public health that has put kids and education workers at risk.

12/13

CR Boxes are great. I wish you all the success possible and hope we can succeed in doing our best to keep our children safe.
