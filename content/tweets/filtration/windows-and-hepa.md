Opening windows and running HEPA filters are two separate ways to clean the air. You want to breathe in air without any virus particles. Air that comes in through the window and air that has been filtered through a HEPA filter are both virus free.

They should both be done. It's not one or the other. If it's cold, keep the window cracked open.

It's best to keep the HEPA filter away from the open window so it is filtering dirty air in the room and not the clean air coming in through the window.
