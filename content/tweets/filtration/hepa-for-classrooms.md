(Assuming CR Boxes are out of the running)

In a typical classroom, you'd want:
Ventilated: about 250 CADR
Under-ventilated: about 500 CADR
Noise: &lt;55dB

@marwa_zaatari has already done the research. Which one would you pick? https://t.co/yf4pCHBdru

![Portable air cleaner comparison](/portable-air-cleaners.jpg)

Look for the cheapest ones with around 250 CADR and noise less than 55 dB. The winners are:
Winix 5500-2
Coway AP-1512HH
Levoit LV-H133

Winix and Coways have ionizers, so Levoit is the most fool-proof. Use 1 for ventilated rooms and 2 for under-ventilated rooms.
