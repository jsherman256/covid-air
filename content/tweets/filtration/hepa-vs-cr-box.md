I'll compare the CR Box to 2 HEPA filters: Levoit LV-H133 & Austin HM400. 

Criteria are: CADR, noise, cost, structure.

### Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR Dust CFM)
|||
|-|-|
|**CR Box**|290-600|
|**LV-H134**|274|
|**HM400**|250|

### Noise 
55 dB is about the threshold for tolerable in a classroom.
|||
|-|-|
|**CR Box**|49-54 dB|
|**LV-H133**|54 dB|
|**HM400**|62 dB|

### Cost (CAD before tax)
|||
|-|-|
|**CR Box**|$90-120|
|**Levoit LV-H133**|$329|
|**Austin HM400**|$850|

![Graph comparing the air purifiers listed above with CR boxes at low, medium and high speeds. CR box is noticably cheaper than either HEPA air purifier and provide more cleaner air (higher CADR). They tend to be quieter as well](/air-cleaners-graph.jpg)

### Structure

|||
|-|-|
|**CR Box**|10 lbs|
|**Levoit LV-H133**|21 lbs|
|**Austin HM400**|47 lbs|

CR Box is bulky and easy to break. It can be easily damaged with a pencil. But the large shape is what allows it to filter so much air. The filters have a lot of surface area and the fan is 20".

Both Levoit and Austin are about 14.5". They are smaller and sturdier. The Austin is extremely durable.

There might be some industrial or medical applications where the Austin is appropriate, but 62 dB is loud for a classroom and it is the most expensive by far.

I picked the Austin HM400 because it is found in many schools and the Ontario gov't purchased 30k of them.

I picked the Levoit LV-H133 because it is one of the [best ones to use for a classroom](https://twitter.com/joeyfox85/status/1483462543314239490).

Unsurprisingly, the CR box has the best CADR and the lowest price. It's a great option.

Many school boards would be hesitant to put in a DIY filter. I've seen people hesitant to use HEPA filters and only want CR boxes. HEPA filters are just as good. Just filter the air!

### Filter Replacements

|||
|-|-|
|**Levoit LV-H133**|$86 every 6-8 months|
|**Austin HM400**|$370 every 5 years|
|**CR Box**|$15-90 every 6 months. When the pandemic ends, you can reduce it to 1 or 2 filters instead of 4. Slight reduction in CADR, but much cheaper filter changes.|

### References

There's a range of values for CR Boxes. It depends on the fan and setup.
