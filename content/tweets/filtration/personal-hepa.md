Many people are wondering if they should bring their own smaller HEPA filter to the office. This is an important question and it's been something I have suggested in the past (I was possibly wrong). Here are my [updated] thoughts.

I haven't seen published studies for a lot of this, so this is my best guess:

Think smoke. If people are smoking in the room, would a small HEPA filter near you help that much? I don't think so. [@ee_kelsey](https://twitter.com/ee_kelsey) did an [experiment](https://twitter.com/ee_kelsey/status/1506271965748867080) to prove this.

### But is there any way to make it work?

Here's [a paper](https://twitter.com/DavidElfstrom/status/1502045109705191433) about the HEPA filter near the infected person, not the susceptible person. When a person expels aerosols, they start off more concentrated and then disperse and mix into the room.

If you are standing in the more concentrated area, risk of transmission is higher. If the HEPA filter is there, it will be filtering out a high percentage of those aerosols before they disperse, so it will be more effective.

The best option might be having a lot of personal HEPA filters spaced out near everyone. This is probably much more effective than larger ones in the corner of the room. You can end up with the same clean air delivery rate, but have it much better mixed in the space.

Another option - plexiglass or physical barrier. [Plexiglass can make things worse]({{<relref "/tags/plexiglass">}}) - but that's if you are relying on the ventilation to provide the clean air.

If you are limiting the air mixing in your vicinity with the rest of the space while filtering that air, it could create a localized area of cleaner air.

Here's a video showing HEPA filter near the aerosol source with plexiglass limiting the mixing.

Does blowing it directly on your face help? I think it depends on the flow and the size of the HEPA filter. A tiny one might not be that effective. [@ee_kelsey](https://twitter.com/ee_kelsey) also gave an example here of how it could work:

### Personal HEPA Filter Summary (IMHO)

- In general - not very effective
- Helps if it's in front of the infected person
- Great if everyone has it
- Use a barrier + HEPA to create a bubble of clean air
- Could be effective if it's large enough blowing on you
