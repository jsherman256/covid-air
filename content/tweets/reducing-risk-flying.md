You will have no control over many of the places you will be. Your best line of defense is a N95. It needs to be properly fit. Some places will be very high risk and a poorly fitted respirator might not be good enough. Do a seal check.

## Getting to the airport

If you're in a taxi, wear your N95 and keep the windows down. “For driving below 30mph (48kph), opening all four windows is most beneficial.
But on faster roads, [opening two on a diagonal can have an even bigger impact](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-58202468).”

## At the terminal

Wear your N95 (notice a pattern). The higher risk times are check-in/baggage, security and customs, where you will be close to people for extended periods. Try to go through this as fast as possible and distance from others. 

At the gate, try to find empty space away from people. It's large, open and usually well ventilated, so overall low risk.

## Boarding

This will be the highest risk time. Once you are on the plane you will be hot-boxed and you can't prevent it.

Ways to minimize risk:

**1. Wear a N95 (no kidding)**

**2. Minimize time - be the last to board if possible. You might lose luggage room in the overhead bin. Prepare accordingly.**

**3. Eye protection - if there was ever at time to use eye protection, this would be it.**

Sealed swimming goggles provide sufficient protection. If you think it makes you look silly, then wear a bathing suit and tell people you are going to the beach.

**4. Personal HEPA filter - keep it blowing on your face (might help)**

## Airplane Ventilation

Air will flow from the nozzles above your head and exhaust by your feet. It provides clean air, either outdoor air or recirculated air filtered through HEPA. 

(Thank you [@CPita3](https://twitter.com/CPita3) for explaining this)

Airlines can run the air conditioning system in different ways:
1. Only when the engine turns on at taxi. Not on the ground.
2. On the ground with the auxiliary power unit (APU)
3. On the ground with a ground cart.
4. On the ground in recirculation mode.

Recirc mode is only filtration and lower flow.

They should always have it running, but don't. Once it's operating at full speed, risk is much lower. You can remove your goggles and turn off the personal HEPA (if you have them). Make sure the air is pointed at your face.

The main risk will be infected people next to you breathing on you. Otherwise, it's a pretty low risk environment.

People often refer to how flying is safe. It's because of the good ventilation/filtration in-flight. They are ignoring being hot-boxed at the gate.

Getting off is a similar story, once air from the nozzle stops, there's no ventilation or filtration, so it's high risk again.

If you can, throughout this whole process, wear a N95, try to move as quickly as possible and distance. Time is a risk factor, so minimize it.
