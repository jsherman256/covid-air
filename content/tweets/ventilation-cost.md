### TLDR
- Start at 2.1 air changes/hour (ACH), 10 CFM/person
- Increase to &gt;8 ACH, 40 CFM/person
- It costs $17/person/year.

I'm not kidding. **$17/person/year can be the difference between awful and amazing ventilation.**

This is the case of replacing a rooftop unit (RTU) with recirculated (recirc) air to one with a heat recovery and remove the recirculated air.

I've explained the basic RTU [here](https://twitter.com/joeyfox85/status/1502097313896046593)

You can replace it with a unit that has no recirculation. It's called a Dedicated Outdoor Air System (DOAS) with a heat wheel. Instead of having only 25% outdoor air, you have 100% outdoor air.

I go through the math of the ventilation in a packaged RTU [here](https://twitter.com/joeyfox85/status/1513608603277545474), but this is what it gives you for a classroom:
- 1000 CFM total supplied
- 250 CFM outdoor air (if it's working properly)
- 10 CFM/person (25 ppl)
- 2.1 ACH

When you get rid of the recirculation, you are bringing in 1000 CFM of outdoor air. This gives you:
- 1000 CFM total supplied
- 1000 CFM outdoor air
- 40 CFM/person (25 ppl)
- 8.4 ACH

And now for the cost: I've just got quoted for these units. A 10 ton unit, supplies 4 classrooms with 1000 CFM each. 
- With recirc: $49,600
- DOAS with heat recovery: $71,200

You can imagine someone replacing a unit, looking at those two prices and opting for the lower one. 

You'd be spending an extra 21.6k. Structural changes are an additional 13k - not a small amount.
But they last 20 years and supply 4 classrooms with 25 people in each. That's 100 people/year for the next 20 years.
In the end, it's just over **$17/person/year**.

That could be the difference between getting COVID 1 time or 8 times. 
You can ramp the fans down and provide only 6 ACH and save energy. The energy lost by the heat recovery is similar to the air exhaust out, so the energy bill wouldn't be too different.

This shows how the lack of will to invest in ventilation can cause so much damage. It's unbelievably short-sited to opt for the cheaper unit. This is a question of values and we need to realign ours. Denying [#COVIDisAirborne](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVIDisAirborne) and denigrating ventilation will hurt us.

Just to reiterate, you will save $17/person/year on tissues from runny noses alone. The benefit from productivity, less sick days and long term health is in the thousands/year pre-COVID. The new normal - that $17 could save 10's of thousands per person every year.
