title: "It's official. I'm chairing the @O_S_P_E Indoor Air Quality Advisory Group. Our society needs a change, so weâ€™re compiling two main documents and shorter targeted summaries to provide the necessary guidance. "

The first document will deal with indoor air quality - how it can be improved, how engineering methods can mitigate exposure to airborne diseases, what goals we can set to accomplish this and how this can be enforced.

The second document will deal with masking - how the use of the right mask can properly protect yourself from airborne pathogens.

We've convened a group of experts comprising of a range of relevant fields, including IAQ, ventilation, filtration and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation research, HVAC engineering, architecture, occupational hygiene, infectious disease research and building commissioning.

We live in a new normal now. The most contagious disease in human history with no lasting immunity is now part of our lives. This disease is airborne and until we learn to clean the air and protect ourselves, we can't resume normalcy.

We need a plan.
We need schooling to not be a super-spreader event.
We need the elderly to be able to get care without the constant fear of contracting a deadly disease.
We need essential workers to be protected.

The misinformation needs to stop.
COVID is airborne & we need to clean the air.
Open windows and HEPA filters are important parts of the response.
Plexiglass isn't a solution.
Breathing is an aerosol generating procedure.
Surgical masks aren't sufficient.

HVAC equipment is health & safety equipment.
Thermostats set to auto and broken fans are health hazards.
We don't leave fire alarms broken and malfunctioning for months.
We need the same with HVAC equipment - CO2 monitoring, checking airflow, accountability and disclosure.

Canada needs a leading professional organization to step up, consolidate the evidence and provide science based guidance on how to mitigate the spread of airborne diseases. @O_S_P_E
 has stepped up. I'm hoping this advisory group can lay out a plan for a new normal.
