My mother got a call from her friend who was panicking. Her husband was sick and tested positive on RAT. She's a cancer survivor and immunocompromised. She didn't know what to do. My mother handed me the phone...

First I told her to follow the CBC advice: 
- do your laundry
- get some Gatorade
- get a nasal spray like Flonase

Also, watch some of our chief medical officers of health press conferences for inspiration.

**I'm kidding again. CLEAN THE AIR!**

First things to do right away were N95s and open windows. Her husband was in the upstairs main bedroom that had a connected bathroom. I told her to make sure the bedroom window was at least cracked open and turn the exhaust fan on.

Then I got to work.

My new normal is to keep a stash of box fans and MERV-13 filters in my basement for emergencies. This was an emergency. I got out my duct tape and got to work. My mother had a spare 15 yo air purifier. We recently changed the filter. We dropped off two gifts at their door.

He ran the HEPA filter in the bedroom. She kept the [#CorsiRosenthalBox](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CorsiRosenthalBox) on and near her where she went. They did that for one week and she didn't get infected.

It's not complicated. N95s and clean air.

They were in an easier situation with a larger house and no young kids.

Not everyone can do everything they did, but it's the same principles. Vaccines, separate, N95s, windows open, air filters, humidifiers, control the air flow. Do what you can.

We aren't helpless.
