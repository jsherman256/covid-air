When the ventilation comes on, some of the air is recirculated from the space and resupplied and some of the air comes from outdoors.

If the poor air is recirculated, that means that there is another room where the poor air is coming from and that's being supplied into your space. This can be exacerbated if there isn't sufficient outdoor air.

The other alternative is there is a source of poor air from the outdoor intake. I've seen intakes in old buildings next to parking lots, so car exhaust could be supplied to the rooms. At an old building I worked at, they violated the building code during roof construction...

The exhaust for the washrooms was ducted a couple feet away from the outdoor intake to the unit - we didn't enjoy the smell too much.
