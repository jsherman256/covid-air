Once COVID began in 2020, this was one of the first things we did - it's low hanging fruit. You can increase the amount of outdoor air entering the unit.

I discuss [here the roof top unit](https://twitter.com/joeyfox85/status/1502097329930883076), but the vast majority of air handling units have a similar layout. The key section we are looking at is the mixed air dampers.

These can modulate between supplying outdoor air or return air. 

If you open the dampers more outdoor air comes in and instead of recirculating the dirty return air, it gets exhausted out.

There are difficulties. I discuss here how [even 25% open can be difficult](https://twitter.com/joeyfox85/status/1513608614547791887) when it's cold outside.

Modulating heating systems can help address this. If the heating is staged on and off like your furnace at home, then you are either supplying cold air or very hot air. It's hard to bring in extra outdoor air without freezing the occupants.

Many buildings use hydronic (water) heating coils. Hot water is passed through a coil, heats up metal fins which then transfer the heat to the air. There's a modulating valve to control the water flow through the coil which ultimately controls the supply air temperature.

![Picture of a hydronic heating coil. It looks like a radiator and has copper piping on the side](/hydronic-coils.jpg)

Modern gas heating units have burners that can also modulate so the heating isn't just on or off. Electrical heating can also modulate.

If there's modulating heating, damper position can be increased even more and the air reheated before it's supplied to the space.

### How much can you bring in?

If you have modulating heating, the limit is the capacity of the heating coil. We programmed it to drop the mixed air temperature to 12 deg C during the heating season. Anything more and you can exceed the capacity of the coil.

### How much does this give you?
```
Outdoor air % = (return air temp - mixed air temp)/(return air temp-outdoor air temp)
```

Standard space temperature in the winter is 21 deg C and we drop the mixed air temp to 12, so it's:
`OA% = 9/(21-Outdoor Air Temp)`

Here are the numbers:

|Outdoor air temperature|Outdoor air %|
|-|-|
|12|100|
|10|82|
|6|60|
|0|43|
|-4|36|
|-10|30|

Most units are designed for 20% OA. Once it gets below -10 deg C, it's hard to bring in more outdoor air than normal.

### How much does this help?

It really depends on the system. I'll give a typical example of a classroom where 1000 CFM is supplied and 25% is outdoor air, so 250 CFM of outdoor air. That's 1.8 air changes per hour and 10 CFM/person if there are 25 people. Poor ventilation.

As you bump it up to 100%, you'll get 7.5 air changes/hour and 40 CFM/person. Amazing ventilation. 

Modern minimum standards are around 400 CFM, 3 ACH, 15 CFM/person, 40% outdoor air.

In the end, this can significantly increase the ventilation.

### What are the disadvantages?

Ventilation uses up about 10% of a building's operating cost. Increasing the outdoor air increases this cost. A cheaper way to deal with this is MERV-13 filters in the air handling unit or HEPA filters/CR Box (these also have costs, but less).

This removes more return air from the space and replaces it with outdoor air instead of recirculating it. There's still an unknown about the risk of recirculated air, but it seems to be far lower than shared room air.

This also doesn't work well when it's cold outside.

If it's around -10 deg C outside, it doesn't do much.

Aside from COVID, this will effectively lower CO2 levels and create a better environment.

At this time of year, you can open the dampers all the way.
