### Fan Needlessly Slows Down

This is complete negligence.

It's done by all the leading rooftop unit manufacturers.

The [rooftop unit](/tweets/intro-to-rtu/) is used for 2 main things: ventilation (fresh air) & temperature control (heating and cooling).

The fan is preprogrammed for 2 speeds:

1. Heating or cooling are required, so the fan goes at proper speed.
2. Heating and cooling aren't required, so we're going to reduce the ventilation and save energy because no one will notice.

This shouldn't be allowed.

It's similar to "auto mode" on the thermostat for your furnace, where it turns off when heating or cooling aren't required. In this case, it doesn't turn off but ramps down the fan.

When ventilation is required, [never have it on "auto mode"](https://twitter.com/DavidElfstrom/status/1488881727862976518)

### How To Diagnose

Noise, drafts & CO2.

You should be able to hear the fan ramp up and down. If not, quite often you'll feel the air move when the high speed kicks on, you need to be paying attention. You'll also notice an increase in CO2 level when on low speed.

### How To Resolve

I've spent lots of time with manufacturers ensuring this doesn't happen at my schools. Probably happens everywhere else. You'll need to speak with the building manager. Make sure they get an engineer to confirm if this is a "constant air volume system".

If it's constant volume, the fan shouldn't be ramping up and down. They need a technician to ensure it's running at constant design speed, even if heating and cooling is off. 

If it's a variable air volume system, then ramping up and down is expected and designed for.
