We need different sensors for these measurements, but these sensors do not last that long. CO2, relative humidity, air flow, and pressure sensors require cleaning from dust, recalibration or replacement and unless someone complains, no one does it.

When you are using an airflow sensor to ensure that the correct amount of outdoor air is supplied and then in 6 months it gets clogged up with dust and gives garbage readings, you can be sure the ventilation won't be working.

When you use CO2 to reduce the required ventilation and broken sensors are telling the unit that ventilation isn't needed, [the unit will shut off outdoor air to the space](https://twitter.com/jasmith_yorku/status/1540067767776428033).

There's a disconnect in the HVAC industry. The engineer designs a system that could work very well, but there's no requirement to ensure it is operated properly. Neglect ensues and a fancy design becomes a sick building.

Unless there is a proper plan to maintain these sensors from the beginning, these sensors cannot be relied upon. Unfortunately, this includes CO2. ASHRAE has [recommendation on maintenance](https://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/Technical%20Resources/Standards%20and%20Guidelines/Standards%20Addenda/62.1-2016/62_1_2016_al_20190826.pdf) every 5 years, but it isn't required to be followed.

>Verify the accuracy of permanently mounted sensors whose primary function is outdoor air delivery monitor- ing, outdoor air delivery verification, or dynamic mini- mum outdoor air control, such as flow stations at an air handler and those used for demand control ventilation, including CO2 sensors. A sensor failing to meet the accu- racy specified in the O&M Manual shall be recalibrated or replaced. Performance verification shall include output comparison to a measurement reference standard consis- tent with those specified for similar devices in ASHRAE
15 Standard 41.2 or ASHRAE Standard 111

The solution isn't to avoid these sensors. It's to ensure they are maintained. We currently don't have any system in place to ensure that. So until we do, relying on these sensors that require ongoing maintenance is a recipe for failure.
