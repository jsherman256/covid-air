### Exhaust only ventilation

This is common in buildings from the 50's era. Long before we had modern standards, ventilation was bad. These buildings are considered to be "not mechanically ventilated". 

Some buildings might not even have a main exhaust fan, but most have at least the exhaust fan. These make up about [30% of Ontario schools](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/kitchener-wateroo-stepehen-lecce-schools-safe-1.6167986).

An exhaust fan is on the roof and ducts were run to every room. This creates negative pressure in the space. 

Enough air should leak in through the windows or doors to provide some outdoor air.  

The main problems are:
1. It wasn't designed for enough air to leak in. For classrooms, it's usually 250 CFM where modern standards are closer to 500 CFM.
2. You can't have that much fresh air coming in from outside - it can be very cold.
3. Ever replace the windows to make them leak less? It probably happened in the past 70 years. Now they provide even less ventilation.

### What can you do?
- always [check the ventilation](https://twitter.com/joeyfox85/status/1476217494658592769). There is an exhaust grille in the room - usually inside wall. Hold a tissue on a stick to make sure it's sucked in.
- keep the windows open as much as possible.
- add filtration (HEPA filter or CR Box)

If [the tissue doesn't get sucked in](https://twitter.com/joeyfox85/status/1476217494658592769), alert the building operator to fix the fan.

Long term fixes are: 
- install unit ventilators in every room
- add in new ductwork and install a new HVAC unit to provide proper ventilation
- knock the building down and start over

These "exhaust only ventilation" buildings are some of the worst when we discuss sick buildings. None of the long-term fixes I stated are easy. It's not just mechanical equipment. It requires more heating capacity, gas consumption, electrical, structural...hard to fix.

There are carefully designed modern natural ventilation buildings, but not common in Canada. One I know of has mechanical ventilation, but for free cooling, there are motorized dampers on the wall that open and exhaust fans turn on. It's a glorified automatic window.

My personal opinion is this system is doesn't work well in Canada. There aren't enough "free cooling" days, when it's cool outside, but still hot inside. It might be worth it in some places, but not here.
