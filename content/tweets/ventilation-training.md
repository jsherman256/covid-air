**1. The cheapest thing to do is to look & listen.** Find the diffusers where the air is coming from and try to listen for it. When you can't hear it - something is wrong. Be mindful of the ventilation wherever you are.

**2. Start checking thermostats.** Go around and ask people to see them - you‚Äôre a ventilation expert now. Make sure the thermostats are all in Fan or On and not Auto. You can either be polite and breathe in everyone‚Äôs backwash ‚Äì or make your voice heard for clean air.

**3. If this is a space where you'll be for a long time** (classroom or office), then get a ladder or someone who can climb a ladder safely. Tape some strips of plastic to the diffusers. You can constantly check the airflow by watching the strips flap. Just look up!

**4. Time for some investments** - [magnetic telescoping pickup tool](https://www.amazon.ca/Zerodis-Telescopic-Magnetic-Extending-Handheld/dp/B07DNZJQ5V/ref=asc_df_B07DNZJQ5V/). Fits in your pocket. If you are 5'8" or so, a 25" opened rod is sufficient to reach diffusers that are 9' high (most buildings). If you're shorter, you'll need a longer one.

Attach a tissue to the end with tape or hair clips. Wait until no one is looking, and check the airflow coming from the diffuser. If you don't see it flapping, start complaining. You have a right to clean air! Collapse it back and put it in your pocket before you're caught.

**5. If you are very bold, find an open storage closet and borrow a mop or broom.** Keep some tape and a tissue with you. Tape it on top and start your own building commissioning. Remember, if they catch you, [tell them you're a ventilation expert](https://nypost.com/2020/08/26/doe-assessing-classroom-airflow-with-toilet-paper-attached-to-sticks/).

**6. Final step of becoming an expert - CO2 monitoring.** This is more expensive than other measures, but it measures air quality and not just air flow. Must be NDIR sensor to trust it.

H/T to [@LadyScorcher](https://twitter.com/LadyScorcher) getting CO2 monitors into libraries.

It can be done!!! üëèüëèüëè

It shouldn't come as a surprise that [@twpiggott](https://twitter.com/twpiggott), the Medical Officer of Health for [@Ptbohealth](https://twitter.com/Ptbohealth) is leading the way. He was the first MOH to recognize [#COVIDisAirborne](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVIDisAirborne) and was a PH leader on N95s. Air quality is his next great initiative.

Try to do this in your own community. There are people here to help.

Make sure the building operator knows you want the **CO2 < 800 ppm**. You'll have proof and they'll have nothing to hide.

You are now a ventilation expert. Use your expertise to keep everyone else healthy.

![A graphic showing how different concentrations of CO2 approximate different levels of ventilation. less than 600 ppm Excellent; less than 800 ppm Good; 800+ ppm needs more ventilation; 1000+ CAUTION; 5000+ DANGER](/covid-air/CO2-ppm.png)

Here are additional CO2 sensors which are less expensive.
