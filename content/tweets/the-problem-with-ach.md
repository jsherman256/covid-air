*ACH is simple and easy.*
<3 ACH bad, 3-4 okay, 5-6 good, > 6 ACH is great.
What's wrong?

The only thing that matters is the room volume, but room volume isn't relevant for indoor air quality.

The area of the room and the number of people matter, but the ceiling height doesn't - in fact, it's the opposite.

If you keep ventilation constant and increase the ceiling height, the concentration of pollutants stay the same - no increased risk.

If you are dealing with a virus that can decay or deposit, [higher ceilings with the same ventilation (lower ACH) will be safer](https://portfolio.cpl.co.uk/CIBSE/202106/42/). As long as the air is properly mixed, there's no need to increase ventilation. This is current ASHRAE standards.

If you keep the same amount of people, but shrink the space so everyone is closer together, would you want more or less ventilation per person? ACH would reduce it.

By ignoring the amount of people and including ceiling height, ACH is not a proper metric for air quality.

Here are some meaningful metrics:

**Mitigating COVID** - 700 CFM/infectious person (estimate based on 6 ACH in a classroom). Filtration or UV can also work.

**Low CO2** - 26 CFM/person (<800 ppm)

**Area** - 0.9 CFM/sq ft (based on 6 ACH in rooms with 9' ceilings)

ACH is useful for calculating how long to wait for flushing out a room, but that's about it. There are historical or mathematical reasons that ACH is used, but it doesn't mean it's meaningful when setting air quality targets.
