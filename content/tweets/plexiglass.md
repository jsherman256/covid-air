**[#COVIDisAirborne](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVIDisAirborne) and transmits in three general situations:**

1. Short Range
2. Shared Room
3. Long Range

Plexiglass stops short range transmission as it prevents you from breathing in the concentrated aerosols directly leaving the infected person's mouth/nose.

For shared room airborne transmission, proper ventilation is an important mitigation measure.

Plexiglass *restricts* the ventilation and allows a localized concentration of aerosols from eddies. This increases the likelihood you can get infected.

The fact that [plexiglass has been shown to increase the risk of infection in schools](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh2939) is proof that when students are sitting at their desks, shared room transmission is a higher risk than short range transmission.

**The conclusion is:**

For situations where short range transmission is the risk - eg. cashiers and receptionists, plexiglass can be helpful.

For situations where shared room transmission is the risk - eg. classrooms and restaurants, plexiglass increases risk.

For people using plexiglass to mitigate short range transmission, there is always the risk of increased aerosol concentration and it can be mitigated by using a HEPA filter near your breathing zone to ensure the air is clean.
