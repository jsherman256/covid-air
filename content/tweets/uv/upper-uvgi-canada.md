I started emailing all the UV companies I could find. I ended up finding 8 that sell upper room UVGI fixtures: 
- AeroMed 
- Atlantic UV
- Lakeshore High Purity/UV Resources
- Sanilume/Illumisoft
- Prescientx
- UV Can
- Signify/Philips
- Light Progress

2/5

Sanilume, Prescientx & Signify are all in the process of getting their product approved by Health Canada. They all told me that no one else is approved yet. 

The other companies didn't raise this concern. Not sure why.

3/5


Important to know: almost all the companies tried to sell me other UV products I didn't want. You need to know the different ways UV is used and you only want upper room UV. Avoid the surface cleaning, and duct mounted UV.

The most surprising thing was my discussion with Sanuvox. This is a UV company and the salesperson was completely unaware that upper room UV existed. They only have stand-alone, duct mounted and surface cleaning equipment.

Next thread I'll discuss the fixtures.

5/5

I’ll just add to clarify, the point was upper room uv is barely used or approved in Canada. Currently, it’s pretty sad. Even the most established UV companies here have no upper room UV products. I had to search through over 30 companies to find those 8.
