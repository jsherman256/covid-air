If you have concerns about simply putting UV lights into kid's classrooms, they are founded. Ed expressed concerns about some of the products I had investigated. Either they had features which would make them ineffective or were way to powerful to control.

2/15

With his guidance, we determined what products would be best. There is still no approval in Canada for these products, they are in the process. But here is what we decided. I'm relying on Ed's expertise, so I don't want to comment on specific products.

Types of Fixtures

First, fixtures can be put into categorized in 2 ways:

louvered/open & ceiling/wall mount

Louvered is for low ceiling. Open is for high ceilings.

Calculating What it Does

Here's the number from Ed Nardell's research:
2 (m^3) (Air Change) / mW.

Or Air Changes = 2x mW of the fixture / volume of the room.

Classroom of 25'x30'x9' = 7.6mx9.1mx2.7m = 187 m^3

5/15

The louvered fixtures are generally between 0.5-0.8 mW. We would use 2 of them on opposite sides of the room as shown in the diagram. Assuming 0.6 mW/fixture:

Air Changes = 2 (m^3) (Air Change) / mW x 600mW/fixture x 2 fixtures/ 187 m^3 = 12.8 Air Changes!

Why not put a single ceiling mounted one in the middle? It would possibly cut the installation costs and save a fixture. But, these work best when the wall is far away so the energy is absorbed by the air. When done like this, the light can travel across the whole room.

7/15

By using a ceiling mounted fixture in the center, the light only travels across half the room. If the beam is too powerful, it can reflect off the walls and into the lower room. The beam mostly stops at the walls, so it cleans less air.

8/15

His initial recommendation is 4 fixtures, but that would break the bank and 12 ACH is not bad, even though 24 is better. The fixtures should be placed slightly staggered on the sides of the classroom. Not front and back where people could be staring at them all day.

9/15

There are some smaller rooms which are narrower. One is sufficient for those. It's best to put it where the longest distance is between walls.

10/15

For rooms with higher ceilings, you want open fixtures which have more power. If the walls are far away, ceiling mounted becomes a good option. However, beware of gyms. Basketballs can fly around. The safest thing to do is wall mount with a cage to protect it.

11/15

At my kid's school, the gym is 47'x65'x20' or 14.3m x 19.8m x 6m= 1700m^3. The open fixtures are 6.25 W.
If we used 2 of them:

Air Changes = 2 (m^3) (Air Change) / mW x 6250mW/fixture x 2 fixtures/ 1700m^3 = 14.7 Air Changes!

This works well with high ceilings.

12/15

You could also go to 3 fixtures and get 22 air changes. Similar calculations can be done with other common areas like the lunch room. No products in Canada have approval yet, but at least I know how many to order and how to install them.

13/15

Once they are installed, they need to be commissioned. People need to take a UV-C meter and walk around the room ensuring there are no significant reflections into the lower room and the light remains in the upper room.

14/15

Final note - This technology has been used for over 100 years. 0 people have been seriously injured from upper room UV. Meanwhile, hundreds of millions of people have died and billions have suffered long term damage from airborne diseases (COVID, TB, measles...)

Did anyone notice that my units were off?ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Air changes/hour, not air changes.
The louvered fixtures (tweet 6) are 0.6 W or 600 mW and not 0.6 mW. 

I wish there was an edit button.
