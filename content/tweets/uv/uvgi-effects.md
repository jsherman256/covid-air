UVGI stands for Ultra Violet Germicidal Irradiation. It's also sometimes called GUV - Germicidal Ultra Violet. It uses light at a specific wavelength to kill microbes (viruses, bacteria, mold...).

What is UV?
Light is electromagnetic radiation. It propagates by particles called photons. Quantum mechanics shows these also propagate as waves, so they have a wavelength. Based on the wavelength, they have different properties. We've arranged them into these categories:

As the wavelength gets smaller, the frequency gets higher and the energy of the particle increases. In the UV spectrum and higher frequencies, it can knock electrons off atoms and cause unwanted chemical reactions. This is why UV light can cause skin cancer.

The UV spectrum is generally broken into three sections: UVA, UVB and UVC.

UVA and UVB can reach the earth's surface from sunlight. UVC is stopped in the upper atmosphere and never reaches the surface. UVA & UVB are responsible for skin damage/cancer.

The biological effects of UVC are different and that's why it's used for UVGI.

First, UVC doesn't penetrate as far into the skin as UVA/UVB, but can damage the outer layer.

If you're exposed to UVC, there are 2 main symptoms:
photokeratitis  - eye redness (like sand in the eyes)
erythema - skin reddening (like a mild sunburn)

UVC doesn't penetrate the skin well, so cancer risk is low.

UVC is also more energetic than UVA/UVB, so it is good at killing viruses. Shorter wavelength UVB can kill viruses too, but it's more dangerous for burning and skin cancer.

If there's a number you need to memorize for UVC, it's this: 254 nm. UVGI UVC is usually created by low pressure mercury lamps and 90% of the energy is released at 254 nm.

254 nm is also very close to the most effective wavelength for killing many microbes. For example, this is for E. coli:

The other energy emitted is a problem though - UV with wavelength < 240 nm can generate ozone. This doesn't happen with 254 nm. Whenever UVGI systems are used, you need to make sure it's only 254 nm and other wavelengths don't irradiate the space.

To summarize, UV @ 254nm can irritate your eyes/skin, but no long term damage. It kills microbes  and doesn't create ozone. In future posts, I'll show how it's used for upper room UVGI.
