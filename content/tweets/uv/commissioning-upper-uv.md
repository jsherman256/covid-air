I'll explain here what happened, what upper room UV should look like when installed properly, what happens if it isn't installed properly, what I've done for my own due diligence and how commission works.

2/10

The people who installed the system installed it at the wrong height and upside down. Upper Room UV shines UV-C light into the upper room and not into the lower room where people are. 

This is a proper installation (from Light Progress):

This is what happens when you have incompetent fools playing around with this stuff.

I've described the effects of UV-C here, but the main concerns are temporary irritation/burns to your eyes and skin. This doesn't cause cancer, but it isn't a joke.

I've been looking into installing these systems at my kid's school. I've spent hours with emails and meetings with leading experts on this because I understand it isn't a joke.

Once it's installed, you are supposed to check the system. You walk around with a UV-C meter and ensure that safety limits for UV-C radiation are not exceeded in the lower room. There's a presentation here at 1:01:30.

ASHRAE and the Illumination Engineering Society have a joint document about how to ensure the system is safe. There are clear limits on how much UV-C you can be exposed to and the entire room needs to be scanned to ensure this doesn't happen.

8/10

Systems can be setup incorrectly or light can reflect down from the ceiling. That's why you need experienced and trained professionals to do this. 

If I get the go ahead to install this system, I will reach out to the experts who do this for a living to get them to do it.

9/10

These aren't toys. I'm concerned that these ignorant and incompetent decision makers at SUNY Geneseo have done a lot of damage. This could impede the deployment of important technology that protects people from COVID.
