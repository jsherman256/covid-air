### Variable Air Volume Systems

Supplying air to the spaces can serve 2 main functions – ventilation (outdoor air) and temperature/humidity control (can use recirculated air). More air is required for temperature/humidity control.

If the space is satisfied from a temperature perspective, you can just supply outdoor air and supply less air to the space. You vary the volume of the air being supplied and save energy. That's why it's called variable air volume.

While these systems can work, they are more complicated than constant volume systems and a lot can go wrong. Here’s a sample (CYA these examples are not from my work):
1. They rely on various sensors to ensure everything is supplied properly. Those sensors can fail.
2. I've seen unit conversion mistakes - it was specified for 250 litres/second and programmed at 250 cubic feet/minute. About half the necessary ventilation.
3. These systems have a lot of moving parts, so more things can fail. 
4. I've seen places incorrectly programmed to shut off ventilation if heating or cooling weren't required.
5. I've seen consultants design the system to meet ventilation requirements at maximum airflow and not minimum airflow (big mistake).

Variable air volume systems have a lot of ways to fail and no oversight or accountability to ensure they remain working properly.

They can save energy, but there's a massive disconnect between those that design the system and those that watch it operate on a daily basis.

So what can you do to stop this?

First step is to [become a ventilation expert]({{<relref "ventilation-training">}}), especially steps 3 & 6 - constantly monitor airflow and monitor CO2.

If you ever see the airflow stop, something is wrong. It should never happen when people are there.

If the air looks like it's [barely trickling out of the diffuser](https://twitter.com/joeyfox85/status/1512128635528003586), that could also indicate an issue. You can confirm this from the CO2 measurement.

If this happens, tell the facility manager there isn't enough flow and to raise the minimum airflow rate. 

Unfortunately, to properly solve this, you would need an engineer to investigate the original design and an air balancer to confirm it's operating properly.
