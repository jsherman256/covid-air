### No Airflow

The air starts in the air handling unit and is delivered to the space. Here's a sample of possible issues:
- broken starter
- blown fuse
- broken control module
- someone shut it off
- damaged ducts
- broken fan belt
- bad programming
- thermostat on auto
- wiring problem

### How You Can Diagnose

Only ventilation experts have the ability to do this â€“ and [you can easily become one]({{<relref "ventilation-training">}}). It's really not hard

### How Professionals Diagnose

I use all the "ventilation expert" methods, but the easiest way to do this is with a building automation system (BAS). You look at your computer and if you are commanding a fan to turn on and the status is off, you know it has failed.

It's also pretty easy just to walk through the mechanical rooms or go to the roof periodically to confirm everything is still running.

### What To Do
If you notice a problem, contact the building operator and tell them there is no airflow. Demand it's fixed. QED

### Rant ðŸ˜€

A broken fan is a health hazard. This issue is surprisingly common, yet so easy to find if you are looking. This highlights something crucial I've learned about my industry during this pandemic.

Most lay-people are unaware and uneducated about ventilation systems. 

Most people running buildings don't have the necessary appreciation of the importance of ventilation. There's insufficient oversight, but this industry can't be fixed overnight.

I'm becoming more convinced that the best way forward is to educate people about ventilation.

Teach them how to determine if there's a problem and how to advocate for themselves. That's why I've started tweeting in the past 5 months. People need to understand how these systems work and how to ensure they are protected. Public displays of CO2 levels will help.

An issue like a broken fan can have a drastic impact on your health, but could be very easy to diagnose if you are looking and could also be easy to fix. Anyone reading this already knows a lot more than the vast majority of people. Pass on this info. Keep everyone safe.
