description: (not from work or my kids’ school).
summary: There were outbreaks where most of the class got infected. There was a new ventilation system installed 2 years ago. It should have been great ventilation. I asked them to get a CO2 monitor to check.

There were outbreaks where most of the class got infected. There was a new ventilation system installed 2 years ago. It should have been great ventilation. I asked them to get a CO2 monitor to check.


CO2 was more than 2000 ppm throughout the day! I checked the airflow with [a tissue and a broomstick](https://twitter.com/joeyfox85/status/1476217494658592769). No airflow.

### What happened?

It’s a VVT system that was designed to reduce airflow when heating wasn’t needed. Should be set to have a minimum amount of air. However: mechanical installed it with factory settings, air balancer only measured maximum airflow, consultant didn’t verify.

They are now investigating and fixing it. This is surprisingly common. Things slip through the cracks. I’ve caught this many times when commissioning new installations. Empowering and educating teachers to check ventilation is an important strategy we need.
