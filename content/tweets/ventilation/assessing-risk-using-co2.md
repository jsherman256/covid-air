The risk of getting COVID is [based on the dose](https://twitter.com/joeyfox85/status/1536128012189679616) - the number of virus particles you inhale. It's related to the virus concentration in the air x your breathing rate x time you are exposed.

The virus concentration = `rate of aerosol generation / rate of aerosol removal`. 

Generation is related to [how many infectious people there are](https://twitter.com/joeyfox85/status/1536804782282838017), how infectious they are and the activity.

Removal is `ventilation + filtration + UV + decay + deposition`.

From all the removal mechanisms, ventilation is usually the most significant. You care about the sum of all the removal mechanisms. The more removal, the cleaner the air and the lower the risk.

CO2 levels do not tell you the total ventilation. CO2 allows you to calculate the amount of ventilation per person. Then you multiply by the amount of people to get the total ventilation.

You assess the risk by summing all the removal mechanisms:
ventilation (flow/person x # people) + filtration + uv...

Low generation & high removal = low risk

It's counterintuitive, but comparing two rooms with the same CO2 level, the one with more people means better ventilation which means lower risk.

However, more people means you are more likely to encounter an infected person, so there's a trade off.

If you are in a busier area with low CO2, it means the ventilation is working well and the building is protecting you.

If CO2 levels are okay, but there's low occupancy, there could be very poor ventilation and you just need to hope that there are no infected people there because there are very poor removal mechanisms.

### Summary

- risk = aerosol generation/removal
- ventilation is the main removal method
- CO2 measures ventilation per person.
- multiply that by # of people to calculate total ventilation
- you can have low CO2 & low # people and bad ventilation - still high risk.
