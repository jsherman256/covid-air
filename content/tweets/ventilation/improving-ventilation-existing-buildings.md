Most North American buildings have mechanical ventilation, but are under-ventilated. You can improve improve them by:
### 1. Increasing the outdoor air %.

### 2. Reprogramming 

Reprogramming variable air volume systems to increase airflow. This could easily double the ventilation. Combine with increase outdoor air, it can quadruple it. [This is on the CDC website btw.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/ventilation.html)

### 3. Heat Recovery

HVAC units last about 20 years.  When replacing them, add a heat recovery to quadruple the amount of outdoor air. [It costs $17/person/year](https://twitter.com/joeyfox85/status/1514688794133504000). That solves all your problems. No significant energy increase.

If a building has no mechanical ventilation, it can still be fixed in one of two ways:

### 1. Dedicated Outdoor Air System
Run the ductwork and put a dedicated outdoor air system on the roof. We've done this plenty of times. It costs money, but the health damage done by leaving it costs more.

I recently saw a natural ventilation (no mechanical ventilation) school built in the 1960s. There was a second project called "ventilation remediation" in the 1970s.  They realized natural ventilation makes people sick. They fixed it and installed mechanical ventilation.

There are many projects like this going on right now. It's not fanciful.

### 2. Unit Ventilators

You can put unit ventilators in every occupied room in a building. I'm personally not a fan of this because I find these units have poor control and are vulnerable to freezing. But it's an option.

Windows + fans can also make a difference. 

Most important thing to do is make sure the equipment that you have is functioning as was intended in the design. That goes a long way and could solve most of the problems.

This is about cost. Especially in the age of COVID, poorly ventilated buildings cause more economic damage than the cost of fixing them. It's not even close. 
[Pre-COVID, $1 spent on ventilation lead to $160 payback](https://twitter.com/joeyfox85/status/1523465157241753600).

I've left out filtration and UV which can also be used for mitigating transmission without any structural changes.
