If you have a HEPA filter or CR box, that isn't ventilation. Most furnaces just recirculate air. Running these will not lower your CO2 levels.

Ventilation can be put in 2 different categories: natural and mechanical.

**Natural ventilation** is either controlled: opening windows or doors, or uncontrolled: outdoor air infiltration. The air is not filtered, heated or cooled.

You can increase natural ventilation by putting a fan in one window.

This has limitations: wasting energy, the capacity of your furnace/ac, and comfort. It's hard to open windows when it's freezing outside, but even cracking a little helps.

**Mechanical ventilation** refers to bringing in outdoor air with a dedicated unit containing fans. This air is passed through a filter to remove dust and then is heated or cooled to be more comfortable when supplied to the space.

Most homes do not have mechanical ventilation.

You can add mechanical ventilation to your home with a heat recovery ventilator (HRV) or energy recovery ventilator (ERV). Both exhaust air from the house and bring in outdoor air to replace it. There's a heat exchanger to bring the incoming air to a better temperature.

The difference between them is humidity. HRV does not transfer humidity between the exhaust and outdoor air while the ERV does. If you want one, choose the type based on your climate. [Here's a good map](https://www.ecohome.net/guides/2276/choosing-between-an-hrv-and-an-erv/).

These units connect into your furnace and use your duct system to supply the ventilation through your house. It pulls out some of the return air and replaces it with outdoor air.

Most AC or window units do not provide ventilation. They just recirculate the air.

**Do you need a HRV or ERV?**

Modern houses have less infiltration of outdoor air and legally require them. Older houses don't. Govt of Canada [recommends](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/publications/healthy-living/carbon-dioxide-home.html) average daily home CO2 level below 1000 ppm.

If your home is below that, then [you don't need a HRV/ERV for general health](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1488935). If it's above that, you can get one or be more diligent about opening windows. Cost effectiveness is dependent on climate, but is usually cost effective over its lifetime.

**Mitigating COVID**

The air coming out of each register in a home varies, but can be around 50-100 CFM. A MERV-13 filter in the furnace or ERV/HRV helps clean respiratory aerosols from the air. A CR box is 275 CFM - *around 3-5x as much clean air*.

The furnace does not supply a high quantity of air for mitigating airborne transmission, but might help slightly. If you want to clean more air quickly in your home, use windows + fans and HEPA or CR box.
