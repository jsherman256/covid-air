Two pieces of misinformation have been holding back progress on a focus on ventilation:

**1. The vast majority of transmission happens at close range**

**2. Ventilation doesn't help with short range transmission.**

Lots of transmission happens at close range, but the vast majority of transmission falls in the "we have no idea where it came from" category. Those responsible for contact tracing only traced "close contacts" so all they found was "close contacts". They missed most cases.

Bad science leads to bad methodology which leads to bad results which leads to bad conclusions. Super-spreader events have played a significant role and are not caused by short-range transmission. Close range is high risk, but not the only risk.

Second, [ventilation helps with short range transmission](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34704625/). If those responsible for contact tracing would investigate the ventilation where transmission occurred, we would have a better idea. But they didn't.

This is yet another example how appropriate expertise was left out of the pandemic response which lead to a failure in drawing appropriate conclusions.

These bad conclusions are hampering our ability to solve this problem moving forward.
