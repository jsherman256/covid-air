You have a bunch of people working in your house. You are super cautious and don't want to take any chances, so you put on your N95, HEPA filters and open windows while they are there. Once they leave, how long do you have to continue this for?

### Step 1 - Determine how many air changes you need. 

ASHRAE recommends 3 air changes = 95% reduction in virus particles. If you're more cautious, then go for 5 air changes = 99.3% reduction in virus particles. You can do more, but the benefit is minimal.

### Step 2 - Determine the volume of the place you want to flush. 

Houses usually have 8' ceilings. You can measure it out.

### Step 3 - Determine the clean air delivery rate (CADR). 

For a CR box on low, it's 275 CFM. Blast it on high and you'll get 425 CFM.

For other HEPA filters, get the CADR online or if you have a rated sq ft for it, divide that by 1.55 to get the CADR. For bathroom exhaust fans, assume 1 CFM/sq ft. With 8' ceilings, it's 8 min/ air change.

Windows are tough to calculate:

If you open up windows and doors + fans, it could be 1 air change (AC) every few minutes. If you are flushing, using fans (even without filters) around the house helps to mix the air better. 

### Step 4 - Calculate

`AC = CADR x time / volume` or `Time (min) = 5 AC x volume/CADR`

One more thing you can do - if you have a CO2 sensor, make sure it's calibrated, open up the windows and leave the room. When the CO2 is very close to outdoor air levels, wait a bit and you're good to go.
