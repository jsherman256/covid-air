If you're using a fan in the window to increase the natural ventilation, here are the two things you should do:

**1. Make sure it is exhausting (blowing out)**

**2. Keep it back from the window 50 cm (1.5 ft)**

When exhausting the air, ensure there is another window open for the air to come in. You want to exhaust air out of the room with dirty air (like an isolation room) and replenished through the room with cleaner air.

Keeping it a little back increases the flow.
