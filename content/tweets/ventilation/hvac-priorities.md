Here is how it is prioritized:

### 1. Protect the equipment
This is the number 1 priority. Even if it leads to cold spaces or no ventilation. If the equipment breaks, it's useless. One example is a low limit sensor/freezestat. If there is very cold air coming from an air handling unit, it's shut down.

That stops any ventilation to the building, but it prevents the heating coil from freezing, bursting and destroying the unit.

### 2. Thermal Comfort (ASHRAE 55)
Keeping people comfortable is essential.

Many have advocated for compromising on thermal comfort during the pandemic so that ventilation can be improved. ASHRAE has taken a stance against this. It's also a health issue being cold all day long. 

If an air handling unit cannot maintain thermal comfort, ventilation must be reduced.

### 3. Ventilation (ASHRAE 62.1)
If equipment is safe and the occupants are comfortable, minimum air quality standards must be maintained.


### 4. Energy Savings
Provided the other priorities are satisfied, the goal is to minimize energy usage. Right now during the pandemic, it is reasonable to prioritize air quality over energy savings. It's important to realize that air quality contradicts energy savings.

By bringing in more fresh air, you have to heat that air up. It also costs energy to move more air with a fan. This is why designs use minimum ventilation requirements. Anything more consumes more energy. It's important to discuss what that minimum should be moving forward.
