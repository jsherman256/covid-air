**1. Read [this article](https://hbr.org/2020/04/what-makes-an-office-building-healthy), familiarize yourself and send it to your employer**

The economic case is obvious - sick workers don't make money. 

Spending $40/person on ventilation would save businesses 6.5-7.5 k/year. Every $1 spent, that's > $160 back. PRE COVID! It's gone up since then and any employer not going crazy on ventilation, filtration & upper room UV is going to lose a lot of $.

**2. If you are going indoors and don't want to get COVID, your best defense is a respirator (eg. N95).**

**3. Become a ventilation expert.**

Monitor CO2, put plastic strips on diffusers, always ensure there is flow.

**4. HEPA filters/CR Boxes.**

If they can reduce sick days, they've already paid for themselves.

**5. Windows.**

Open them up. It's super easy and effective at cleaning the air.

**6. Be prepared to fight back on some myths.**

If your employer wants to know what to do, tell them to do everything!
