First, [#COVIDisAirborne](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVIDisAirborne), it spreads like smoke. The more you breathe in, the greater chance you'll get infected.

What to do:

**1. Vaccines - stay up to date**

**2. Rapid tests (RAT)**
- if you are symptomatic (even negative RAT), assume you have COVID
- use RAT to confirm you are +
- once symptoms resolve, use test-to-exit:
  - best 2 neg. RAT on 2 days
  - at least 1 neg. RAT if you can't

**3. Masks**

Wear respirators as much as possible (N95, KN95, KF94 or equivalent). If you can't get one, use a surgical mask with knot & tuck, but it's an inferior option.

**4. Clean the air: (always do this, but if there's COVID, go all out)**
- go outside
- open windows. In the winter, at least crack open. Otherwise, use fans in the windows to increase circulation.
- run HEPA filters or [#corsirosenthalbox](https://twitter.com/hashtag/corsirosenthalbox) . Best place is the room you're in. The more the merrier.
- run exhaust fans if windows are open.
- put a Filtrete 1900 filter in your furnace and run it all the time
- if it's dry, run humidifiers to keep relative humidity at 40%. Especially bedrooms.

**5. Infected person should go into isolation room if possible.**

**6. If you are sharing rooms (like washroom or dining room), especially without masks, clean the air + wait to air it out between uses.**

And close the lid before you flush!

If you know how it spreads, you know how to stop it.

Exposure is inevitable, infection isn't.
