My wife felt sick early last week and then tested positive (RAT). Everyone in our family is now negative. My kids and I never got it. We didn't resort to extreme measures like isolation or kids wearing N95s all day. This is how we did it:

We followed public health advice:
- wore comfortable cloth masks
- washed our hands frequently
- cleaned and disinfected - especially the toys
- practiced safe physical distancing
- put up plexiglass barriers as an extra precaution.

Just kidding. *That's not how it's done.*

**[#COVIDisAirborne](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVIDisAirborne)** Focus on keeping the air clean and you can stop the spread. These are the measures we took:

**Vaccines** - we're all fully vaccinated (including boosters) except my 3 yo. My 4 month old had 2 doses in utero. My 6 yo has 2 doses.

**Masks** - I wore the CAN95 or CAN99 with ear loops. My wife wore a KN95 when she could, otherwise she wore a surgical mask + knot & tuck. It fits her well.

**Filtration** - We have 1 large [#corsirosenthalbox](https://twitter.com/hashtag/corsirosenthalbox) in the main area and 3 minis in the bedrooms.

The CR box is right beside where we eat and where the kids play/watch TV. We turned it up to medium speed for meals. My wife either ate in a different room or waited until we left and ate by herself. We kept windows cracked intermittently.

**Humidifiers** - we ran humidifiers in all the bedrooms every night. Tried to keep the home at 40% RH but because of the cold weather, it stayed around 30%.

With older kids, we could have had them stay in their rooms all day, but that wasn't possible for us.

I moved into the guest room and kept the window cracked. I made sure a room was aired out (3 air changes) before removing my mask. If the kids wanted to play in the basement, I brought one of the mini CR boxes down.

We had a disadvantage - an unmasked, unvaccinated 3 yo. It's been -10 deg C, couldn't open windows for long or go outside. But we have a 4 bedroom single family home which helped.

There's always an element of luck - how contagious someone is - but what we did worked.

- Vaccines work
- Well fitting medical masks work
- Filtration works
- Humidifiers work

My wife's case was mild - she felt fluey and achy for a few days - that's it. Many don't have that.

I've seen horror stories about how contagious this can be - e.g. across hallways in hotels with brief exposure - but those aren't the norm. Those stories do a disservice by making it seem impossible to stop this. It's not. 

Focus on clean air and proper masking (N95s). It can be stopped. Vaccines, humidifiers, filtration, open windows, go outside, respirators... **Infection isn't inevitable.**
