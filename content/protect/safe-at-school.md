**1. Ask the teacher to keep the windows open as much as possible.**

**2. If there is a HEPA filter in the classroom...**

...ask the teacher to move it closer to the center of the room and run it as fast as possible (noise permitting).

**3. Ask the teacher if they can check the ventilation themselves**

**4. Get your kid a respirator.**

We get ours from [Cangard](https://cangardcare.com/product-category/respiratory-protection/kids-mask-respiratory-protection/) because they have nice designs and my kids like them

Here are other Canadian manufacturers:

**5. Tiny USB HEPA filter for their desk**

Maybe [something like this](https://walmart.ca/en/ip/Mini-Portable-Air-Purifier-H13-True-HEPA-Filter-Travel-Size-Purifiers-Car-Baby-Stroller-Desktop-Dual-Fan-Personal-Smoke-USB-Rechargeable-Remove-99-97/PRD2K8LG41B00JW). Might need to get a battery pack separately. Avoid ionizers. 

Any other recommendations?

**6. I'm not a doctor and do not give medical advice, but here's one thing I can say confidently: GET THEM VACCINATED.**

Most of these things should be provided by the govt. That's not happening soon, so we should do the best we can with what we have.
