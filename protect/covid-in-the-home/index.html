If someone is infected, you‚Äôll breathe in a lower dose.\nHere‚Äôs some advice: As we‚Äôve been spending more time indoors, good ventilation remains important.

With good RH, it will fall.\nA üßµon humidity and airborne viruses. Several articles have said that at higher relative humidity (RH), droplets/aerosols retain more water, are larger, and then fall out of the air faster. True, but the effect of RH on biological decay is probably more important. /1\n‚Äî Linsey Marr (@linseymarr) December 27, 2020 3. Low RH makes you more susceptible to airborne diseases.\nIf it‚Äôs cold outside, run humidifiers in your house - especially bedrooms. It‚Äôs good for your health in general. Clean and disinfect them regularly.\nYou Start Feeling Sick The safest thing to do is to act like you have COVID (see below) and rapid test periodically until symptoms resolve or you get a positive test.\nIf you can‚Äôt isolate, then be more diligent about running filters, opening windows and masking.\nYou Test Positive Right away - N95s, open windows, turn on filters.\nIsolation Room If you can, setup an isolation room. Here are some things to do:\n1. Run a filter in the isolation room. If any air escapes, it will have less virus.\nhttps://cleanaircrew.org/someone-in-my-home-has-covid-how-do-we-isolate-safely/\n2. Try to block any paths that the air can leak into the house at the door.\n3. Create negative pressure in the room\nTurn on an exhaust fan in an adjacent bathroom or have a fan blowing air out a window. This will cause air to leak into the room and not out.\n4. Run a humidifier in the room if the air is dry.\n5. If a return vent is located in the isolation room, block it by taping plastic around it\nThey look like this:\nYour Home Furnace Furnace filter: If it‚Äôs a 1‚Äù slot, use the Filtrete 1900. If it‚Äôs a larger slot, get a MERV-13 filter that matches the slot size. If air can‚Äôt reach the far end of the house or the furnace stops working, put back the old filter and reset the furnace.\nFiltrete 1000 also works against aerosols, but 1900 is better. If you have a MERV-13/Filtrete 1000/1900 filter in your furnace, run your fan all the time to get the filtration. If your furnace filter has lower rating, leave it on auto.\nSharing a Bathroom Leave the exhaust fan running between uses and keep the window open. It‚Äôs best to wait between uses, especially if you are not wearing a mask (eg. shower). 25 minutes should be fine if exhaust fan is running. The longer the better.\nPSA: Close the toilet lid before flushing. Inhaling aerosolized fecal matter isn‚Äôt good for you, especially if it‚Äôs virus laden. #CloseTheLid As @DFisman says, air: it‚Äôs the new poop.\nWhen you‚Äôre done, WASH YOUR HANDS!\nSharing other rooms, like a dining room is the same concept. If the infected person used it without a mask, open windows, run filters and wait before using it yourself.\nMasks Wear a N95 as much as possible, especially when not in the isolation room. If you need to take it off (eating, showering, sleeping), make sure the air is clean.\nIn the isolation room, it‚Äôs lower risk to unmask and more comfortable for the infected person.\nIf you don‚Äôt have a N95, use knot \u0026 tuck with a surgical mask.\nFilter Location If you only have 1 HEPA/CR Box or humidifier, I think it‚Äôs best in the room with the infected person as source control and for their health.\nYou can place one outside their room to filter air that leaks out.\nOtherwise, the best room for the filter is the one that you are in. They are portable, so you can carry them around.\nExiting Don‚Äôt listen to US \u0026 Canadian Public Health and wait only 5 days. Best is to wait until symptoms resolve + 2 negative rapid tests on 2 days. At least wait for symptoms to resolve + negative rapid test.\nN95s, filters, open windows, isolate, humidifiers - that‚Äôs it. Some can do more than others, but do what you can.\n#COVIDisAirborne\nIf you know how it spreads, you know how to stop it. Exposure is inevitable, infection isn‚Äôt.
