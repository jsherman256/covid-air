Not on the ground. On the ground with the auxiliary power unit (APU) On the ground with a ground cart. On the ground in recirculation mode. Recirc mode is only filtration and lower flow.\nThey should always have it running, but don’t. Once it’s operating at full speed, risk is much lower. You can remove your goggles and turn off the personal HEPA (if you have them). Make sure the air is pointed at your face.\nThe main risk will be infected people next to you breathing on you. Otherwise, it’s a pretty low risk environment.\nPeople often refer to how flying is safe. It’s because of the good ventilation/filtration in-flight. They are ignoring being hot-boxed at the gate.\nGetting off is a similar story, once air from the nozzle stops, there’s no ventilation or filtration, so it’s high risk again.\nIf you can, throughout this whole process, wear a N95, try to move as quickly as possible and distance. Time is a risk factor, so minimize it.\nIf you are staying at hotels, just follow this thread.
