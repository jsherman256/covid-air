Here are the things you can do.\n1. Respirators\nThese are still the best method we have to mitigate the spread of COVID.\n2. Distance (obviously)\nThis has been one of the key messages this pandemic. It helps with short-range but doesnâ€™t help with shared room transmission.\n3. Plexiglass\nOne of the cases where it can help with short range transmission, but make shared-room transmission worse. Only use in specific circumstances.\nWHEN PLEXIGLASS IS USEFUL AND WHEN IT ISN'T ðŸ§µ\nPlexiglass can be useful in specific situations, but harmful in others. To know why, you need to know the different methods of airborne transmission.\n1/7\nâ€” Joey Fox, P. Eng, M.A.Sc (@joeyfox85) February 1, 2022 Need some caveats before the next methods. They are not legitimate replacements for respirators. If you are in unmasked close contact, there is only so much air cleaning technology can do.\nThere are ways to try to remove the air from the breathing zone quickly before the susceptible person breathes it in. You also need to clean the air once itâ€™s removed. Some of these methods have studies, some is a bit of speculation. These are my thoughts.\n4. Airborne Infectious Isolation Rooms\nYou control the flow through the room. The air gets pulled out of the breathing zone and exhausted right away protecting susceptible people inside.\nWhen a health authority expresses concern that portable HEPA unit placement in a classroom may interfere with ventilation, they may be thinking of best practice clean-to-dirty flow in an AIIR. Just get the filtration in the classroom! PDF: https://t.co/tjExjAwdQa /1 pic.twitter.com/ZaMP4Z5ePJ\nâ€” David Elfstrom (@DavidElfstrom) October 8, 2021 Airplanes have a similar concept. Coughing on someone next to you (18\" / 45 cm away) is equivalent to around 2 m or 6 ft distance without the ventilation. Thatâ€™s a significant reduction in risk, even though itâ€™s far from eliminated.\n5. Aerosol extractor\nItâ€™s a flexible ducted intake to a HEPA filter. You put the hose near the personâ€™s mouth and it sucks the aerosols in before the other person breathes it in. Iâ€™ve seen this at the dentist.\n6. Ceiling Fans\nThese fans can either create currents to pull the air up out of the breathing zone or push air down into the breathing zone. These work well in rooms with high ceilings. It can help in crowded places too.\nThey also help in general to save energy. In the summer when itâ€™s hot, they promote evaporative cooling on your skin requiring less mechanical cooling.\nIn the winter they can push hot air that is buoyant in the upper room into the lower room (destratification).\nBringing air into the upper room in places with high ceilings lowers risk in general. Combining it with upper room UV will do a great job at cleaning the air.\nCeiling fans can improve upper room UV by 60%.\n7. Displacement Ventilation\nDisplacement ventilation is very rare in Canada. The vast majority of mechanically ventilated buildings are mixing ventilation. In mixing ventilation, the air is usually both supplied and returned from the ceiling.\nFor mixing ventilation, we assume the room is well mixed, so things that mix the air in the room like HEPA filters arenâ€™t detrimental.\nDisplacement ventilation is different. Slightly cooler air is supplied near the floor and extracted at the ceiling.\nThis creates an upward current through the room. I canâ€™t say how effective this would be for short range mitigation. The airflow speed is not that high. The air can then be exhausted or filtered in the HVAC unit before being resupplied.\n8. Use a fan for cross-current (beware)\nYou can have a fan blowing air between two people out of the breathing zone, reducing the amount of shared air you breathe in at short range. Youâ€™ll be putting anyone downstream at risk.\nIf itâ€™s a confined, poorly ventilated space, youâ€™ll be blowing the aerosols around and it wonâ€™t protect anyone from shared-room transmission, so you need to clean the air with ventilation, filtration or UV.\n9. Far UV (maybe)\nThis is UV light that is safe enough to shine directly at people, but can still kill viruses. Canâ€™t be certain how effective it will be, but when you have very high air change rates, I suspect it might help to some extent.\n10. General air quality improvement\nGood air quality helps with short range transmission. It isnâ€™t something you can rely on solely, but it can make a difference\nAirborne diseases transmit best at close range. Hereâ€™s what the CDC says about TB.\nWe know that ventilation and upper room UV reduce transmission of TB. They work against COVID too.\n","wordCount":"784","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-07-17T16:57:01Z","dateModified":"2022-07-17T16:57:01Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Joey Fox, P.
