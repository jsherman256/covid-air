If you know how it spreads, you know how to stop it.\nWe aren’t helpless.\nHere’s their stories 🧵:\n👏👏👏\nGot covid. Not sure where. We did what you did. I stayed home from work. Spent my days outside, nights in what was formerly my son’s room. Brought my corsi box home and used air filters. Neither wife nor other son got covid after 10 days.\n— NILs Headley 🇺🇸🇸🇪🇸🇿 (@NilsHeadley) March 14, 2022 I'm immune compromised and stayed negative living with my positive partner. Hepa filter, fans on, open windows (cold in Jan!), N95s, 3 story house, he was double vaxxed (booster 2 days before exposure) and I was triple vaxxed (4th dose 4 days before exposure)\n— DrW (@mw17_dvm) March 14, 2022 Same here (although I think I infected 2 before I knew I was +ve) once I knew I opened all windows, locked down my bedroom and 1 bathroom, ran HEPA air filters 24/7, betadine throat \u0026 nasal rinse on others in house. Even with people working outside, no other infections\n— 💧Nesha Hutchinson (@NeshaHutchinson) March 14, 2022 Husband got it in late December. I had windows open all over off/on all day. Air filter running. We stayed masked unless sleeping in different parts of the house. Used latex gloves, he stayed isolated. Both of us are vaxxed and boosted. I never got it. He was fine after 4 days.\n— MaryL (@Mim5453) March 14, 2022 We did similar. Husband got COVID from work and I’m high risk. -CORSI box in main area\n-no shared meals/ kitchen time -separate rooms and bathrooms\n-religious use of n95 in house for two weeks -filter in room\n-open windows\n— Xenia Zoo (She/Her)💚 (@XeniaZoo) March 14, 2022 My son was exposed in the work truck: tested +, he isolated in his room with window open, we all wore n95 masks, ran one hepa in the hallway and one in the kitchen. We managed to keep everyone else healthy. 🙏 😅\n— Seastars2005 (@LunchboxKim) March 14, 2022 That's exactly what we did and I'm the only one who had it! 3 caregivers and my sons all were safe. We all masked, I was mostly in my room, fans on, 2 large air purifiers in the bedrooms, and usually the front door or back door was open a bit so the ceiling fans worked out.\n— cobalt123 (@cobalt123) March 14, 2022 My young daughter tested positive a month ago. I’m immunocompromised. We immediately masked with n95s. Impossible to isolate young child. HEPA filters on, windows open, masks. Neither of us got it to our surprise\n— Niamh (@Fannkel) March 14, 2022 Exactly what I did when my kid woke me at 3am sick. Sent him to his room.Opened every window on my way to get my N95. corsi box fans everywhere, back of house opened for air, front had reversible fans pushing air out. No one else caught it.\n— JustBreathe (@stargazing90) March 14, 2022 I stopped it in my home too. Daughter had it. Masks, ventilation, social distancing, HEPA filter in my room, fans on. I stayed home from work in case I was infected. Took over 7 days to get results 3X. We even shared a bathroom. I am vaxxed and boosted. I never got it.\n— Rowan Everleigh (@WitchierthanU) March 15, 2022 Daughter aged 14 double vaxxed caught Covid. She isolated in her own room with bathroom .\nTowel under door and HEPA filter ran constantly.\nFood and drinks supplied on tray outside her door.\nCanasta the WhatsApp video chats.\nNo one else in home caught Covid .\n— Denise (@duilleog_eile) March 15, 2022 ","wordCount":"615","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-03-15T03:25:36Z","dateModified":"2022-03-15T03:25:36Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Joey Fox, P.
