This includes flow from ventilation, filtration, decay and deposition. Decay and deposition makeup around 20-30% as a rough estimate.\nComparing Deposition and Decay to Ventilation/Filtration\nThe higher the virus concentration in the air, the more likely you are to get infected. So how do you reduce the concentration?\nA reduction in concentration is proportional to all the way the virus can be removed.\n1/7\n— Joey Fox, P. Eng, M.A.Sc (@joeyfox85) May 17, 2022 I’ll ignore those effects to simplify the math and assume virus is removed only through ventilation or filtration. The estimate will still give a fairly accurate result.\nWith this assumption, if you double the ventilation, the virus concentration gets cut in half.\nSo change in virus concentration = airflow 1/airflow 2\nor New Airflow = Old Airflow/% of virus remaining.\nFor a cloth mask, where 25% removed \u0026 75% of the virus remains, the new airflow = old airflow/0.75 = 1.33 x old airflow.\nSo in a typical classroom with 250 CFM, the cloth mask would create the equivalent of a classroom with 250x1.33 = 332 CFM. The difference is 332-250=82 CFM.\nSo wearing a cloth mask in a classroom has the equivalent effect as a tiny 82 CFM HEPA.\nAnother example: 2-way surgical masks.\nThey each reduce the concentration by 50%, so total virus remaining is 0.5^2=0.25 New airflow=old airflow/0.25 Using 250 CFM New airflow = 1000 CFM The difference is 750 CFM.\nSo 2-way surgical masking is like having an extra 750 CFM.\nI’ve run the numbers for all the different scenarios here. I’ve used typical CFMs of 100, 250, 400 and 500 for classrooms.\nThe table shows what size HEPA filter you would need to get the equivalent benefit.\nEquivalent CFM Ventilation CFM in Classroom 100 250 400 500 Leakage % Cloth Mask .75 33 83 133 167 2-way Cloth .56 78 194 311 389 Surgical .5 100 250 400 500 2-way Surgical .25 300 750 1200 1500 Non-Fit-Test Respirator .2 400 1000 1600 2000 2-way NFT Respirator .04 2400 6000 9600 12000 Fit-Tested Respirator .1 900 2250 3600 4500 2-way FT Respirator .01 9900 24750 39600 49500 Air Cleaning Method Equivalent CFM Ventilation 100-500 Filtration 100-300 each Upper Room UVGI 1000-2000 Far UV 1000-40000 To compare in a classroom setting:\nCR Box (275 CFM) is better than a surgical mask (250)\nGreat ventilation 750 CFM (that’s 6 ACH) + CR box is equal to 2-way surgical masking\nUpper room UV which is equivalent to 1600 CFM is better than a non-fit-tested respirator\nThere were a bunch of assumptions here and it’s not a 100% fair comparison. For example, I used a poor (but common) ventilation of 250 CFM. If you have a room that is at modern standards, a surgical mask will provide the equivalent of an extra 400 CFM. (That’s a lot)\nConversely, if you are in a really poorly ventilated room with 100 CFM (still common), a surgical mask will provide only an extra 100 CFM, like a medium size HEPA filter. A cloth mask will give you 33 CFM - barely anything. 2-way cloth masking is 78 CFM. Still minimal.\nThis all assumes consistent and proper masking.\nSome important takeaways: If you are indoors, there is no better option to protect against infection than a proper fitting respirator.\nBut respirators don’t remove the virus, they only reduce the concentration you inhale.\nMasks are the best tool against short range transmission. Initially when you breathe out, respiratory aerosols are more concentrated. Ventilation can help in that situation, but is less effective. Masks stop short range transmission.\nFor masks in schools - if kids are wearing cloth masks in a poorly ventilated room and not wearing them properly, a CR box or HEPA filter would be much more effective.\nIt shows the importance of air quality and how that amplifies the effectiveness of masks. It also shows why if there is masking, it should be respirators and not cloth masks.\nThis isn’t one or the other, you can do both. But this is a rough comparison between them.\nIMHO: This demonstrates that there is low benefit for mask mandates in poorly ventilated schools where cloth masks are allowed. Especially if not worn properly.\nIf you want an effective way to reduce transmission, you need respirators with good air quality.\nFair criticism of this analysis. I discuss the importance of masks for short range transmission, but here’s the math behind it.\n1/4\nGood thread by @joeyfox85. But the sensitivity of these conclusions to the relative importance of near-field vs far-field transmission cannot be underestimated. @CIBSE_NatVent @WBahnfleth\nLet me explain .. https://t.co/0zXfAAoN2j\n— Prasad Kasibhatla (@PrasadKasibhat1) May 18, 2022 ","wordCount":"924","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-05-17T23:16:32Z","dateModified":"2022-05-17T23:16:32Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Joey Fox, P.
