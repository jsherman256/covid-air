This is looking at it from a different perspective - what\u0026rsquo;s your risk at different CO2 levels and different types of masks.\nThe risk of getting infected is based on the virus concentration in the air. Masks filter the air you breathe in and lower the concentration. I\u0026rsquo;ll use the values from this table.\nMask Leakage Cloth 75% Surgical 50% N95 10% The math is pretty simple:\nN95 has 7.5x less leakage than a cloth mask (75%/10%), N95 has 5x less leakage than a surgical mask (50%/10%) A surgical mask has 1.5 x less leakage than a cloth mask (75%/50%) Now you can look up those values in the table I made. I\u0026rsquo;m assuming that mitigation is purely from ventilation. I\u0026rsquo;m also dealing with shared room and not short range transmission.\nHere\u0026#39;s a table I made so you can avoid calculations.

Eng, M.A.Sc (@joeyfox85) June 8, 2022 Example 1 - Well ventilated classroom with 700 ppm CO2 and wearing a cloth mask.\nThis translates to 26 CFM/person. The equivalent with a N95 is ventilation rates 7.5 x lower = 26/7.5 = 3.5 CFM/person. This translates to around 2500 ppm.\nSo risk in a classroom with 2500 ppm + N95 = risk with 700 ppm + cloth mask.\nExample 2- Office with 700 ppm + surgical mask = 40.7 CFM/person N95 is 5x better, so 40.7/5 = 8.1 CFM/person which is around 1850 ppm.\nSo risk of 700 ppm + surgical = 1850 ppm + N95\nI’ll add on that 10% leakage is not always a valid assumption. With higher leakage, ventilation has an even bigger effect.\nIn the first case, 20% leakage changes it from 2500 to 1500 ppm. Second case changes from 1850 to 1000 ppm. It shows the importance of good ventilation with imperfect masking.\n","permalink":"http://www.itsairborne.com/tweets/ventilation/ventilation-vs-masks-pt2/","summary":"How much does clean air protect you?

Eng, M.A.Sc (@joeyfox85) July 19, 2022 Mechanical ventilation refers to bringing in outdoor air with a dedicated unit containing fans. This air is passed through a filter to remove dust and then is heated or cooled to be more comfortable when supplied to the space.\nMost homes do not have mechanical ventilation.\nYou can add mechanical ventilation to your home with a heat recovery ventilator (HRV) or energy recovery ventilator (ERV). Both exhaust air from the house and bring in outdoor air to replace it. There\u0026rsquo;s a heat exchanger to bring the incoming air to a better temperature.\nThe difference between them is humidity. HRV does not transfer humidity between the exhaust and outdoor air while the ERV does. If you want one, choose the type based on your climate. Here\u0026rsquo;s a good map.\nThese units connect into your furnace and use your duct system to supply the ventilation through your house. It pulls out some of the return air and replaces it with outdoor air.\nMost AC or window units do not provide ventilation. They just recirculate the air.\nDo you need a HRV or ERV?\nModern houses have less infiltration of outdoor air and legally require them. Older houses don\u0026rsquo;t. Govt of Canada recommends average daily home CO2 level below 1000 ppm.\nIf your home is below that, then you don\u0026rsquo;t need a HRV/ERV for general health. If it\u0026rsquo;s above that, you can get one or be more diligent about opening windows. Cost effectiveness is dependent on climate, but is usually cost effective over its lifetime.\nMitigating COVID\nThe air coming out of each register in a home varies, but can be around 50-100 CFM. A MERV-13 filter in the furnace or ERV/HRV helps clean respiratory aerosols from the air. A CR box is 275 CFM - around 3-5x as much clean air.\nThe furnace does not supply a high quantity of air for mitigating airborne transmission, but might help slightly. If you want to clean more air quickly in your home, use windows + fans and HEPA or CR box.\nAs we’ve been spending more time indoors, good ventilation remains important.

They are not legitimate replacements for respirators. If you are in unmasked close contact, there is only so much air cleaning technology can do.\nThere are ways to try to remove the air from the breathing zone quickly before the susceptible person breathes it in. You also need to clean the air once it\u0026rsquo;s removed. Some of these methods have studies, some is a bit of speculation. These are my thoughts.\n4. Airborne Infectious Isolation Rooms\nYou control the flow through the room. The air gets pulled out of the breathing zone and exhausted right away protecting susceptible people inside.\nWhen a health authority expresses concern that portable HEPA unit placement in a classroom may interfere with ventilation, they may be thinking of best practice clean-to-dirty flow in an AIIR.

Coughing on someone next to you (18\u0026quot; / 45 cm away) is equivalent to around 2 m or 6 ft distance without the ventilation. That\u0026rsquo;s a significant reduction in risk, even though it\u0026rsquo;s far from eliminated.\n5. Aerosol extractor\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a flexible ducted intake to a HEPA filter. You put the hose near the person\u0026rsquo;s mouth and it sucks the aerosols in before the other person breathes it in. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this at the dentist.\n6. Ceiling Fans\nThese fans can either create currents to pull the air up out of the breathing zone or push air down into the breathing zone. These work well in rooms with high ceilings. It can help in crowded places too.\nThey also help in general to save energy. In the summer when it\u0026rsquo;s hot, they promote evaporative cooling on your skin requiring less mechanical cooling.\nIn the winter they can push hot air that is buoyant in the upper room into the lower room (destratification).\nBringing air into the upper room in places with high ceilings lowers risk in general. Combining it with upper room UV will do a great job at cleaning the air.\nCeiling fans can improve upper room UV by 60%.\n7. Displacement Ventilation\nDisplacement ventilation is very rare in Canada. The vast majority of mechanically ventilated buildings are mixing ventilation. In mixing ventilation, the air is usually both supplied and returned from the ceiling.\nFor mixing ventilation, we assume the room is well mixed, so things that mix the air in the room like HEPA filters aren\u0026rsquo;t detrimental.\nDisplacement ventilation is different. Slightly cooler air is supplied near the floor and extracted at the ceiling.\nThis creates an upward current through the room. I can\u0026rsquo;t say how effective this would be for short range mitigation. The airflow speed is not that high. The air can then be exhausted or filtered in the HVAC unit before being resupplied.\n8. Use a fan for cross-current (beware)\nYou can have a fan blowing air between two people out of the breathing zone, reducing the amount of shared air you breathe in at short range. You\u0026rsquo;ll be putting anyone downstream at risk.\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s a confined, poorly ventilated space, you\u0026rsquo;ll be blowing the aerosols around and it won\u0026rsquo;t protect anyone from shared-room transmission, so you need to clean the air with ventilation, filtration or UV.\n9. Far UV (maybe)\nThis is UV light that is safe enough to shine directly at people, but can still kill viruses. Can\u0026rsquo;t be certain how effective it will be, but when you have very high air change rates, I suspect it might help to some extent.\n10. General air quality improvement\nGood air quality helps with short range transmission. It isn\u0026rsquo;t something you can rely on solely, but it can make a difference\nAirborne diseases transmit best at close range. Here\u0026rsquo;s what the CDC says about TB.\nWe know that ventilation and upper room UV reduce transmission of TB.

More air is required for temperature/humidity control.\nIf the space is satisfied from a temperature perspective, you can just supply outdoor air and supply less air to the space. You vary the volume of the air being supplied and save energy. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s called variable air volume.\nWhile these systems can work, they are more complicated than constant volume systems and a lot can go wrong. Here’s a sample (CYA these examples are not from my work):\nThey rely on various sensors to ensure everything is supplied properly. Those sensors can fail. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen unit conversion mistakes - it was specified for 250 litres/second and programmed at 250 cubic feet/minute. About half the necessary ventilation. These systems have a lot of moving parts, so more things can fail. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen places incorrectly programmed to shut off ventilation if heating or cooling weren\u0026rsquo;t required. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen consultants design the system to meet ventilation requirements at maximum airflow and not minimum airflow (big mistake). Variable air volume systems have a lot of ways to fail and no oversight or accountability to ensure they remain working properly.\nThey can save energy, but there\u0026rsquo;s a massive disconnect between those that design the system and those that watch it operate on a daily basis.\nSo what can you do to stop this?\nFirst step is to become a ventilation expert, especially steps 3 \u0026amp; 6 - constantly monitor airflow and monitor CO2.\nIf you ever see the airflow stop, something is wrong.

You can confirm this from the CO2 measurement.\nIf this happens, tell the facility manager there isn\u0026rsquo;t enough flow and to raise the minimum airflow rate.\nUnfortunately, to properly solve this, you would need an engineer to investigate the original design and an air balancer to confirm it\u0026rsquo;s operating properly.\n","permalink":"http://www.itsairborne.com/tweets/ventilation/common-issues/variable-air-volume/","summary":"These systems are standard in most places, but a lot can go wrong causing poor ventilation.

Verify the building ventilation is working\n2. Clean the air in your suite\n3.

Here\u0026rsquo;s how to check the ventilation:\nUse a CO2 monitor. If it\u0026rsquo;s high, you know something is wrong. Go into the hallway and ensure air is being supplied. You can hold the CO2 monitor to the supply air and measure the CO2 being supplied. It should be around 420 ppm (100% outdoor air) Hold a tissue to the exhaust grille in the washroom and ensure that air is being exhausted. Check to make sure air is flowing under the door. There might be units in the room for heating and cooling, but they only recirculate air. No ventilation.\nIf there are issues with any of this, notify the front desk.\nClean the air in the suite Open windows and run a HEPA filter. It\u0026rsquo;s best to place it near the door so you are filtering the air that is entering from the hallway.\nBlocking the door If the windows don\u0026rsquo;t open and the system is working properly, it will be detrimental to block the door. Air is exhausted through the washroom and has to be replenished from somewhere.\nIf it doesn\u0026rsquo;t come through the door, it could leak in through the walls of a different suite.

This is current ASHRAE standards.\nIf you keep the same amount of people, but shrink the space so everyone is closer together, would you want more or less ventilation per person?

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can come from perfume or deodorant.\nThe space can give off pollutants as well. VOCs can come off paint from walls, cleaning products or chemicals on furniture. Construction materials can contain asbestos and other materials. Carpets are also sources of pollutants.\nHere are 5 metrics:\n1. Flow per area This metric ignores ceiling height. The people and majority of objects emitting chemicals are on the ground. If the ventilation supplied is properly going to the breathing zone, then you don\u0026rsquo;t care about the ceiling height or volume of the room.\nImagine two spaces with the exact same people and objects, but one had a 10 ft higher ceiling. Does the ventilation need to change there? With proper air mixing - no.\nThis metric also ignores how many people are there.\n2. Air changes per hour (ACH) ACH is how many times the air in a room is changed every hour. In 1970, CDC set 6 ACH for infection control. The only factor is volume. ACH is used by indoor air quality experts and in medical settings.\nThis ignores how many people are there. It\u0026rsquo;s useful if you care about clearing a hazard from the air in a room like flushing out a room from COVID once someone leaves it. You want to wait a certain amount of air changes before the coast is clear.\nIt might also be relevant if it\u0026rsquo;s a high ceiling and you need more ventilation because of stratification (poor mixing between upper and lower rooms). But usually if you double the ceiling height, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to double the ventilation.\n3. Flow per person When people are equally emitting pollutants, you care about the flow per person. Since CO2 is a pollutant per person, CO2 levels are an indication of the flow per person. This also relates to body odor.\n4. Virus removal per infectious aerosol generation This is what you\u0026rsquo;ve been waiting for - how to use ventilation to mitigate against COVID. The probability of getting infected is related to the concentration of virus in the air.\nConcentration = Generation/Removal Generation = # infected ppl x activity x infectiousness Removal = deposition (landing on surfaces) + decay (virus inactivating over time) + ventilation flow + filtration flow + UV Generally, ventilation is the most significant factor of the removal mechanisms.\nSome of these factors are difficult to know to fully assess risk, but the main point is the ventilation is not dependent on the number of uninfected people and the size of the space.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve been using ACH as the metric, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s misguided. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain:\nRemember this study? 6 ACH reduces school outbreaks 82%. That might be the wrong metric. Assuming 1 infected source in a classroom (typical for an outbreak) and a typical volume of 7000 cubic ft, you get: 7000x6/60=700 cubic ft/minute (CFM).\nThe study showed that 700 CFM of outdoor air in a classroom can reduce outbreaks by 82% - the volume of the room wasn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily the correct metric. Perhaps more outbreaks occurred in smaller classrooms since they had less total flow. (We don\u0026rsquo;t know)\nWe can also see the issue with comparing this to flow per person. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you have 30 people and 1 is infected and you have 23 CFM/person - that\u0026rsquo;s 700 CFM/infected person. Outbreak chances reduced by 82%.\nNow half of them leave and you keep the same flow per person (this is called demand control ventilation). Now your flow is 350 CFM total, so 350 CFM/infected person. Outbreak chances have now significantly increased.\nThis is why ACH (not dependent on # people) is better than flow/person for airborne mitigation (I state this in the thread about good ventilation). Although the truth is, if you care about airborne mitigation, the real metric is flow/infected person.\n5. ASHRAE 62.1. This is how design ventilation rates are currently calculated. It\u0026rsquo;s a combination of flow per area and flow per person. The goal of this was to address sick building syndrome - when 20% or more of people complained about the air quality.\nThese rates (ventilation per person and per square foot) are adjustable based on the type of space since gyms, nail salons, classrooms and food processing facilities all have different types of occupants, activities and contaminants.\nHowever, these rates were not designed to prevent infection from airborne disease.\nSo why does this matter? We need to know what our goals are. If the goal is to stop COVID in public spaces, then flow/infected person is what matters.\nIt can also be from ventilation, filtration or ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI)-makes no difference.\nIf we want better test scores, attentiveness and productivity, that\u0026rsquo;s been related to CO2 levels which is outdoor air flow/person. Filtration and UVGI don\u0026rsquo;t help.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re providing ventilation to a one person office, no need to mitigate airborne exposure.\nIf there are plenty of pollutants from the space, the area matters.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re flushing a space between uses, you care about ACH.\nIf there are high ceilings and poor mixing between the upper and lower rooms, then you\u0026rsquo;ll need higher airflow to compensate which means volume is more important than just the area. This can also be mitigated with a destratification fan.\nACH is a straightforward metric, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think there is a basis in physics to use it as an infection control metric which is done in medical settings. This could cause underventilation of small rooms and overventilation of large rooms.\nIf we want to improve air quality, assess risk and protect people from COVID, we need to use the correct metrics and tools to achieve the desired goals. Other factors like room size, activity and humidity also matter. I\u0026rsquo;ll deal with that in an upcoming thread.\n","permalink":"http://www.itsairborne.com/tweets/ventilation/right-metric-for-clean-air/","summary":"We know we want cleaner air, but it\u0026rsquo;s not completely clear how to measure it.

You can increase the amount of outdoor air entering the unit.\nI discuss here the roof top unit, but the vast majority of air handling units have a similar layout. The key section we are looking at is the mixed air dampers.\nThese can modulate between supplying outdoor air or return air.\nIf you open the dampers more outdoor air comes in and instead of recirculating the dirty return air, it gets exhausted out.\nThere are difficulties. I discuss here how even 25% open can be difficult when it\u0026rsquo;s cold outside.\nModulating heating systems can help address this. If the heating is staged on and off like your furnace at home, then you are either supplying cold air or very hot air. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to bring in extra outdoor air without freezing the occupants.\nMany buildings use hydronic (water) heating coils. Hot water is passed through a coil, heats up metal fins which then transfer the heat to the air. There\u0026rsquo;s a modulating valve to control the water flow through the coil which ultimately controls the supply air temperature.\nModern gas heating units have burners that can also modulate so the heating isn\u0026rsquo;t just on or off. Electrical heating can also modulate.\nIf there\u0026rsquo;s modulating heating, damper position can be increased even more and the air reheated before it\u0026rsquo;s supplied to the space.\nHow much can you bring in? If you have modulating heating, the limit is the capacity of the heating coil. We programmed it to drop the mixed air temperature to 12 deg C during the heating season. Anything more and you can exceed the capacity of the coil.\nHow much does this give you? Outdoor air % = (return air temp - mixed air temp)/(return air temp-outdoor air temp) Standard space temperature in the winter is 21 deg C and we drop the mixed air temp to 12, so it\u0026rsquo;s: OA% = 9/(21-Outdoor Air Temp)\nHere are the numbers:\nOutdoor air temperature Outdoor air % 12 100 10 82 6 60 0 43 -4 36 -10 30 Most units are designed for 20% OA. Once it gets below -10 deg C, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to bring in more outdoor air than normal.\nHow much does this help? It really depends on the system. I\u0026rsquo;ll give a typical example of a classroom where 1000 CFM is supplied and 25% is outdoor air, so 250 CFM of outdoor air. That\u0026rsquo;s 1.8 air changes per hour and 10 CFM/person if there are 25 people. Poor ventilation.\nAs you bump it up to 100%, you\u0026rsquo;ll get 7.5 air changes/hour and 40 CFM/person. Amazing ventilation.\nModern minimum standards are around 400 CFM, 3 ACH, 15 CFM/person, 40% outdoor air.\nIn the end, this can significantly increase the ventilation.\nWhat are the disadvantages? Ventilation uses up about 10% of a building\u0026rsquo;s operating cost. Increasing the outdoor air increases this cost. A cheaper way to deal with this is MERV-13 filters in the air handling unit or HEPA filters/CR Box (these also have costs, but less).\nThis removes more return air from the space and replaces it with outdoor air instead of recirculating it. There\u0026rsquo;s still an unknown about the risk of recirculated air, but it seems to be far lower than shared room air.\nThis also doesn\u0026rsquo;t work well when it\u0026rsquo;s cold outside.\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s around -10 deg C outside, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t do much.\nAside from COVID, this will effectively lower CO2 levels and create a better environment.\nAt this time of year, you can open the dampers all the way.\n","permalink":"http://www.itsairborne.com/tweets/ventilation/increasing-outdoor-air/","summary":"Once COVID began in 2020, this was one of the first things we did - it\u0026rsquo;s low hanging fruit.

For a new classroom, minimum required CADR is around 400 CFM. Typical is 250 CFM (poor). Really good air quality would be around 750 CFM.\nMasks reduce the concentration of the virus you inhale. This table shows the concentration reduction for the different masks.

This includes flow from ventilation, filtration, decay and deposition. Decay and deposition makeup around 20-30% as a rough estimate.\nComparing Deposition and Decay to Ventilation/Filtration\nThe higher the virus concentration in the air, the more likely you are to get infected. So how do you reduce the concentration?\nA reduction in concentration is proportional to all the way the virus can be removed.\n1/7\n\u0026mdash; Joey Fox, P. Eng, M.A.Sc (@joeyfox85) May 17, 2022 I\u0026rsquo;ll ignore those effects to simplify the math and assume virus is removed only through ventilation or filtration. The estimate will still give a fairly accurate result.\nWith this assumption, if you double the ventilation, the virus concentration gets cut in half.\nSo change in virus concentration = airflow 1/airflow 2\nor New Airflow = Old Airflow/% of virus remaining.\nFor a cloth mask, where 25% removed \u0026amp; 75% of the virus remains, the new airflow = old airflow/0.75 = 1.33 x old airflow.\nSo in a typical classroom with 250 CFM, the cloth mask would create the equivalent of a classroom with 250x1.33 = 332 CFM. The difference is 332-250=82 CFM.\nSo wearing a cloth mask in a classroom has the equivalent effect as a tiny 82 CFM HEPA.\nAnother example: 2-way surgical masks.\nThey each reduce the concentration by 50%, so total virus remaining is 0.5^2=0.25 New airflow=old airflow/0.25 Using 250 CFM New airflow = 1000 CFM The difference is 750 CFM.\nSo 2-way surgical masking is like having an extra 750 CFM.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve run the numbers for all the different scenarios here. I\u0026rsquo;ve used typical CFMs of 100, 250, 400 and 500 for classrooms.\nThe table shows what size HEPA filter you would need to get the equivalent benefit.\nEquivalent CFM Ventilation CFM in Classroom 100 250 400 500 Leakage % Cloth Mask .75 33 83 133 167 2-way Cloth .56 78 194 311 389 Surgical .5 100 250 400 500 2-way Surgical .25 300 750 1200 1500 Non-Fit-Test Respirator .2 400 1000 1600 2000 2-way NFT Respirator .04 2400 6000 9600 12000 Fit-Tested Respirator .1 900 2250 3600 4500 2-way FT Respirator .01 9900 24750 39600 49500 Air Cleaning Method Equivalent CFM Ventilation 100-500 Filtration 100-300 each Upper Room UVGI 1000-2000 Far UV 1000-40000 To compare in a classroom setting:\nCR Box (275 CFM) is better than a surgical mask (250)\nGreat ventilation 750 CFM (that\u0026rsquo;s 6 ACH) + CR box is equal to 2-way surgical masking\nUpper room UV which is equivalent to 1600 CFM is better than a non-fit-tested respirator\nThere were a bunch of assumptions here and it\u0026rsquo;s not a 100% fair comparison. For example, I used a poor (but common) ventilation of 250 CFM. If you have a room that is at modern standards, a surgical mask will provide the equivalent of an extra 400 CFM. (That\u0026rsquo;s a lot)\nConversely, if you are in a really poorly ventilated room with 100 CFM (still common), a surgical mask will provide only an extra 100 CFM, like a medium size HEPA filter. A cloth mask will give you 33 CFM - barely anything. 2-way cloth masking is 78 CFM. Still minimal.\nThis all assumes consistent and proper masking.\nSome important takeaways: If you are indoors, there is no better option to protect against infection than a proper fitting respirator.\nBut respirators don\u0026rsquo;t remove the virus, they only reduce the concentration you inhale.\nMasks are the best tool against short range transmission. Initially when you breathe out, respiratory aerosols are more concentrated. Ventilation can help in that situation, but is less effective. Masks stop short range transmission.\nFor masks in schools - if kids are wearing cloth masks in a poorly ventilated room and not wearing them properly, a CR box or HEPA filter would be much more effective.\nIt shows the importance of air quality and how that amplifies the effectiveness of masks. It also shows why if there is masking, it should be respirators and not cloth masks.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t one or the other, you can do both. But this is a rough comparison between them.\nIMHO: This demonstrates that there is low benefit for mask mandates in poorly ventilated schools where cloth masks are allowed. Especially if not worn properly.\nIf you want an effective way to reduce transmission, you need respirators with good air quality.\nFair criticism of this analysis. I discuss the importance of masks for short range transmission, but here’s the math behind it.\n1/4\nGood thread by @joeyfox85.

So what can you do?\nASHRAE recommends leaving the HVAC units running for 3 air changes after occupancy ends (this reduces any virus particles by 95%).\nSo if a person with COVID is in a room and coughs lots of virus into the space, then then they leave the space, the HVAC system turns off (no flushing) and the virus particles linger. Someone walks in 20 minutes later and breathes in enough virus particles to get infected.\nBut if the HVAC system stayed on, virus removed, no infection.\nThis might be true if the room is unoccupied for less than an hour or so, possibly more, but\u0026hellip;\nWhat happens if the HVAC system turns off over night without flushing and no one is in the building for 8 hours?\n1.

Buildings aren\u0026rsquo;t air tight, there\u0026rsquo;s always some leakage - generally around 0.5 air changes/hour or more.\n3. Depositing\nAerosols deposit on surfaces just like dust deposits on surfaces. If it isn\u0026rsquo;t in the air, you won\u0026rsquo;t breathe it in.\nPoint is, the risk is negligible that someone will get COVID in a room that hasn\u0026rsquo;t had someone in it for 8 hours, even with the HVAC system off.\nSome zones are controlled by a motion sensor. If there\u0026rsquo;s occupancy, the HVAC unit turns on and if not, it turns off. It makes sense to stop this during COVID. During occupied hours, the system should stay on in case someone left virus laden aerosols in the air.\nBut once occupancy is over for the day, I think there is minimal benefit in flushing the building when there\u0026rsquo;s 8 hours or more before the next occupancy. It also wastes a lot of energy.\nIMHO, flushing buildings at night doesn\u0026rsquo;t help. Leaving HVAC running during the day might have helped in a small amount of cases, but hasn\u0026rsquo;t made a significant impact compared to outdoor events, HEPA filters and ventilation upgrades.

Even though the airflow reduces, they become more efficient. Better filters can also handle more dust before restricting airflow significantly.\nThe difference in airflow over the filter change period isn\u0026rsquo;t significant and for variable volume systems, the fan compensates for the increased pressure drop across the filter, so there\u0026rsquo;s no reduction in flow. At best, there might be minimal energy savings.\nSo for COVID, ASHRAE recommends LESS FILTER CHANGES!!!\nConsider letting the filter load up further than usual to reduce frequency of filter changes.\nDon’t let pressure drop increase enough to disrupt room pressure differentials Confirm filters are snug in their frames, preferably with gaskets to prevent filter bypass It\u0026rsquo;s not a typo. They confirm it in the FAQ on this page.\nBefore investigating this, I would have thought that frequent changes are a little helpful, but not significant.

When they are fully \u0026ldquo;closed\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s 100% return air and 0% outdoor air. When they are \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s 0% return air and 100% outdoor air.\nDampers are designed to fail in the \u0026ldquo;closed\u0026rdquo; position - no outdoor air. Why? This protects the equipment and the people in the space. Bringing in 100% outdoor air can damage the equipment and freeze or overheat the occupants.\nIf the heating or cooling system are broken, people will notice and complain. If ventilation isn\u0026rsquo;t working, most people don\u0026rsquo;t notice. This even happens when fans are broken for long periods of time. If dampers break, they remain broken.\nPreventative maintenance should fix this, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t. A school I investigated (not from work) in August 2020 had 16 RTUs. 9 of them had broken dampers. The maintenance contractors didn\u0026rsquo;t bother checking or fixing them since no one complained.\nHow To Diagnose The only way a non-professional can do this is by monitoring the CO2. If you check the flow from the diffusers, it will look normal. You\u0026rsquo;d expect CO2 levels to rise since outdoor air isn\u0026rsquo;t being supplied.\nThere might be days that the CO2 looks okay. There could be some outdoor air leakage through the dampers, low capacity or if the windows are open, it would be fine. But that\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s important to constantly monitor the CO2.\nIn my job, I can easily diagnose this from the building automation system. From the temperatures inside the unit, if the dampers are supposed to be open, but the mixed air temperature (MAT) equals the return air temperature (RAT), they have failed.\nWhen I commission units, I also check the flow going into the outdoor air damper and also visually confirm it\u0026rsquo;s moving from the outside. You can also see the backdraft dampers flapping from the exhaust air. HVAC technicians can check by opening up the unit.\nThis is typical of a constant problem with the industry. There is no incentive to fix broken dampers.\nIt costs money Costs effort and time Increases utilities bill No one will notice No oversight or enforcement Why bother? And so they remain broken.\nTwo things we can do is work on regulations to fix this (good luck) and educating people to advocate for themselves. If there\u0026rsquo;s high CO2 levels or smells linger for too long, first check the air flow. If it\u0026rsquo;s fine, ask the building operator to ensure the dampers are working.\n","permalink":"http://www.itsairborne.com/tweets/ventilation/common-issues/broken-dampers/","summary":"Broken Dampers.

The different definitions tell you different information.\nImperial units for air flow is cubic ft/minute (CFM) Metric is liters/sec (LPS)\n1. CFM (LPS)/Person If you are worried about the air quality issues created by every person, this is the metric to use. My first boss told me that a room with 50 people has 50 bums and 100 arm pits. This is relevant for body odor and CO2 levels.\n2. Air Changes per Hour (ACH) ACH = 60xCFM/Volume or 3600xLPS/Volume\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t take occupancy into account - only the volume of the room. It\u0026rsquo;s relevant for COVID. If there is one infected person in the room, it makes no difference how many other people are there.\nYou care about how quickly the ventilation system can clear the virus out of the room.\n3. ASHRAE 62.1 Ventilation Guidelines (10 x # ppl + 0.12 x sq ft.)/0.8 (in CFM)\nThis has more details. It takes both occupancy and the area into account.\nThe values are different depending on the situation, but I\u0026rsquo;ve used the numbers for classrooms with heating (pg 17,23). A discussion of the basis of 62.1 can be found here.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t count the volume of the room (only area) which is relevant for rooms with high ceilings.\nDemand Control Ventilation (DCV) DCV is a energy saving method based on occupancy. When there are fewer people and lower CO2 levels, you reduce the ventilation.\nFrom what I just explained, the issue is obvious. CO2 measures the ventilation/person, so with DCV ventilation will be reduced, even though the prevention of airborne transmission is related to the ACH. 2 different metrics relating to different uses.\nIf we want to use ventilation to mitigate airborne virus transmission, then DCV might be a thing of the past. An alternative is to reduce ventilation only to spaces with no occupancy. This requires room by room control with motion sensors - more complicated and expensive.\nThis also shows the limitation of CO2 monitoring. CO2 monitoring tells you the flow/person and not ACH. It can alert you to issues with ventilation. But low occupancy can still lead to low CO2, even if there is a low ACH - poor ventilation.\nSo what is good ventilation? For airborne transmission risk: 4-6+ ACH. Now that we live in the COVID era, we need more data. A higher ACH might be necessary going forward - especially in places prone to super-spreader events.\nAssuming 800 sq ft classroom, 9\u0026rsquo; ceilings, 25 ppl.

I\u0026rsquo;m not kidding. $17/person/year can be the difference between awful and amazing ventilation.\nThis is the case of replacing a rooftop unit (RTU) with recirculated (recirc) air to one with a heat recovery and remove the recirculated air.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve explained the basic RTU here\nYou can replace it with a unit that has no recirculation. It\u0026rsquo;s called a Dedicated Outdoor Air System (DOAS) with a heat wheel. Instead of having only 25% outdoor air, you have 100% outdoor air.\nI go through the math of the ventilation in a packaged RTU here, but this is what it gives you for a classroom:\n1000 CFM total supplied 250 CFM outdoor air (if it\u0026rsquo;s working properly) 10 CFM/person (25 ppl) 2.1 ACH When you get rid of the recirculation, you are bringing in 1000 CFM of outdoor air. This gives you:\n1000 CFM total supplied 1000 CFM outdoor air 40 CFM/person (25 ppl) 8.4 ACH And now for the cost: I\u0026rsquo;ve just got quoted for these units. A 10 ton unit, supplies 4 classrooms with 1000 CFM each.\nWith recirc: $49,600 DOAS with heat recovery: $71,200 You can imagine someone replacing a unit, looking at those two prices and opting for the lower one.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d be spending an extra 21.6k. Structural changes are an additional 13k - not a small amount. But they last 20 years and supply 4 classrooms with 25 people in each. That\u0026rsquo;s 100 people/year for the next 20 years. In the end, it\u0026rsquo;s just over $17/person/year.\nThat could be the difference between getting COVID 1 time or 8 times. You can ramp the fans down and provide only 6 ACH and save energy. The energy lost by the heat recovery is similar to the air exhaust out, so the energy bill wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too different.\nThis shows how the lack of will to invest in ventilation can cause so much damage. It\u0026rsquo;s unbelievably short-sited to opt for the cheaper unit. This is a question of values and we need to realign ours. Denying #COVIDisAirborne and denigrating ventilation will hurt us.\nJust to reiterate, you will save $17/person/year on tissues from runny noses alone. The benefit from productivity, less sick days and long term health is in the thousands/year pre-COVID.

Unfortunately, RTUs are often incapable of providing sufficient ventilation. Here\u0026rsquo;s the math why:\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll deal with a typical classroom:\n25 people, 800 sq ft x 9\u0026#39; ceilings = 7200 cubic ft Current ASHRAE minimums are:\n(25x10CFM/person+800x0.12CFM/Sq ft)/0.8 = 432 CFM outdoor air 0.8 is a factor for hot air. See standard 62.1-2019 pg 19,23\nTo calculate the air changes/hour:\nACH = 60xCFM/Volume = 0.0083xCFM ASHRAE minimum: ACH = 0.0083x432 = 3.5 Most of our modern installations have 500 CFM/classroom = 4.15 ACH\nNow what can you get out of an RTU?\nTo start, you have to size the total flow (outdoor air + recirculated air). Here\u0026rsquo;s a description how it\u0026rsquo;s sized, but the main factor is the cooling load. For a typical Canadian classroom it\u0026rsquo;s 2-3 tons. The unit is then sized at 400 CFM/ton.\nTaking the middle value of 2.5 tons/classroom (I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this a lot), the unit supplies a total of 1000 CFM.\nNow we know how much total air is supplied, what % of outdoor air can be supplied?\nThe limiting factor is the supply air temperature without heating.\nImagine a day where it\u0026rsquo;s cold outside (-5 °C). You can\u0026rsquo;t leave the heating running all the time or you\u0026rsquo;ll overheat. Sometimes it will need to turn off and when this happens, the mixed air temperature is the same as the supply air temperature.\nIf the return air temperature is 21 °C (typical space), outdoor air temp is -5 °C and you are supplying 25% Outdoor Air (25% OA), the mixed air temperature will be:\nMAT = RAT - OA% * (RAT-OAT) = 21 - 0.25(21 - (-5)) = 14.5 °C When the heating is off, the supply air temperature will be the same temperature as the mixed air temperature. Supplying 14.5 °C air to the space is extremely uncomfortable. People will complain right away. An HVAC mechanic could solve this by reducing the ventilation.\nEven if you were to supply 25% outdoor air, which I\u0026rsquo;ve shown cannot be done comfortably on cold days, that\u0026rsquo;s only 250 CFM of outdoor air. ASHRAE minimum is 432 CFM. You\u0026rsquo;re about 58% of the minimum. This also equates to 2.1 ACH. A very low level of ventilation.\nThe point I\u0026rsquo;m getting at is the simple cheapest option of the packaged rooftop unit is nowhere near capable of comfortably supplying minimum standards of ventilation. Modern classrooms don\u0026rsquo;t use these, but these are common in buildings from the 90s.\nYou can find these in many places like strip malls. However, those have lower occupancy than classrooms, so it might be okay sometimes.\nNext thread I\u0026rsquo;ll show how a more modern unit with heat recovery can fix this problem and the costs involved in upgrading.\n","permalink":"http://www.itsairborne.com/tweets/ventilation/common-issues/the-rooftop-unit/","summary":"The basic building block of the HVAC world is a ventilation problem?","title":"Common Issues: The Rooftop Unit"},{"content":"Source\nTwo pieces of misinformation have been holding back progress on a focus on ventilation:\n1.

This includes: poorer concentration, sleepiness, headaches\u0026hellip;It\u0026rsquo;s not certain if it\u0026rsquo;s causation or correlation (ASHRAE document).\nAssessing risk of spread of airborne diseases is different. Here\u0026rsquo;s why:\n2.2 Health and Cognitive Effects of CO2 Exposure\nIndoor concentrations of CO2 greater than 1000 ppmv have been associated with increases in self-reported, nonspecific symptoms commonly referred to as sick building syndrome (SBS) symptoms. However, these observations were not controlled for other contaminants or environmental parameters; therefore, elevated CO2 concentrations likely served as indicators of inadequate ventilation that increased the concentrations of all contaminants with indoor sources. More recently, several groups have explored the cognitive effects of short-term exposure (2 to 8 h) to pure CO2 at concentrations between 600 and 5000 ppmv. Some of these studies demonstrated concentration-dependent impairment, an indicator of a causal effect, but other studies did not show any effects on cognition. These inconsistencies require further investigation, including study of the mechanisms involved. This research is a priority due to the ubiquity of indoor concentrations of CO2 in excess of 1000 ppmv.\n1. Occupancy A thought experiment: You go to a spin class in the summer of 2020 and follow all public health guidelines including sanitizing and safe physical distancing, yet somehow there is a super-spreader event and everyone is shocked. 😲\nA member of team #COVIDisAirborne planted a CO2 monitor and finds out it was at 2500 ppm. Easy to solve this problem.\nBut rerun the experiment with only half the people there, including the infectious person that was the source. What happens?\nEveryone else there still gets sick, but CO2 levels will be much lower. Might be closer to 1500 ppm. That\u0026rsquo;s because to get infected, it\u0026rsquo;s how much of the infectious person\u0026rsquo;s breath you are breathing in, not everyone\u0026rsquo;s.\nThis is why if there is lower capacity, low CO2 doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean good ventilation.\n2. Unoccupied CO2 levels I\u0026rsquo;ve seen people posting about good CO2 levels in empty rooms. CO2 comes from people. Once the people leave the room, CO2 levels drop.\nThey drop from either mechanical ventilation flushing the space or from infiltration - outdoor air naturally entering the space. This tells you nothing about the ventilation when the space is at capacity.\n3. Time I was at a weekday synagogue service (I don\u0026rsquo;t carry CO2 monitors on Shabbat😀). Gigantic room, about 20% capacity, 1.5 hours long. CO2 started around 700 ppm and went up to 1100 ppm over the service. 1100 is still not extremely high. My suspicion\u0026hellip; no ventilation. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t hear it on either. It takes a while for the air in the room to circulate through peoples lungs. After a couple more hours, it would be much higher.\n4. Aerosol to CO2 ratio Coughing produces about 1000x more aerosols than breathing, but not that much more CO2. The risk of infection is related to the aerosol concentration which can significantly vary from the CO2 concentration depending on the activity.\n5. Other factors reduce risk Ventilation is one of a list of measures to reduce risk. Levels of filtration, masking and types of masks, vaccination status and community prevalence are all other factors that contribute to risk.\nTo summarize: Bad CO2 indicates bad ventilation. Good CO2 doesn\u0026rsquo;t always mean good ventilation. CO2 is not a perfect gauge of aerosol concentration. Ventilation is important, but it is one of multiple measures that is used. It\u0026rsquo;s not the only gauge of risk.

Keep the windows open as much as possible and run humidifiers, HEPA filters or CR Boxes. If someone is infected, you\u0026rsquo;ll breathe in a lower dose.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s some advice: As we’ve been spending more time indoors, good ventilation remains important.

True, but the effect of RH on biological decay is probably more important. /1\n\u0026mdash; Linsey Marr (@linseymarr) December 27, 2020 3. Low RH makes you more susceptible to airborne diseases.\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s cold outside, run humidifiers in your house - especially bedrooms. It\u0026rsquo;s good for your health in general. Clean and disinfect them regularly.\nYou Start Feeling Sick The safest thing to do is to act like you have COVID (see below) and rapid test periodically until symptoms resolve or you get a positive test.\nIf you can’t isolate, then be more diligent about running filters, opening windows and masking.\nYou Test Positive Right away - N95s, open windows, turn on filters.\nIsolation Room If you can, setup an isolation room. Here are some things to do:\n1. Run a filter in the isolation room. If any air escapes, it will have less virus.\nhttps://cleanaircrew.org/someone-in-my-home-has-covid-how-do-we-isolate-safely/\n2. Try to block any paths that the air can leak into the house at the door.\n3. Create negative pressure in the room\nTurn on an exhaust fan in an adjacent bathroom or have a fan blowing air out a window. This will cause air to leak into the room and not out.\n4. Run a humidifier in the room if the air is dry.\n5. If a return vent is located in the isolation room, block it by taping plastic around it\nThey look like this:\nYour Home Furnace Furnace filter: If it’s a 1” slot, use the Filtrete 1900. If it\u0026rsquo;s a larger slot, get a MERV-13 filter that matches the slot size. If air can\u0026rsquo;t reach the far end of the house or the furnace stops working, put back the old filter and reset the furnace.\nFiltrete 1000 also works against aerosols, but 1900 is better. If you have a MERV-13/Filtrete 1000/1900 filter in your furnace, run your fan all the time to get the filtration. If your furnace filter has lower rating, leave it on auto.\nSharing a Bathroom Leave the exhaust fan running between uses and keep the window open. It\u0026rsquo;s best to wait between uses, especially if you are not wearing a mask (eg. shower). 25 minutes should be fine if exhaust fan is running. The longer the better.\nPSA: Close the toilet lid before flushing. Inhaling aerosolized fecal matter isn\u0026rsquo;t good for you, especially if it\u0026rsquo;s virus laden. #CloseTheLid As @DFisman says, air: it\u0026rsquo;s the new poop.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re done, WASH YOUR HANDS!\nSharing other rooms, like a dining room is the same concept. If the infected person used it without a mask, open windows, run filters and wait before using it yourself.\nMasks Wear a N95 as much as possible, especially when not in the isolation room. If you need to take it off (eating, showering, sleeping), make sure the air is clean.\nIn the isolation room, it\u0026rsquo;s lower risk to unmask and more comfortable for the infected person.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have a N95, use knot \u0026amp; tuck with a surgical mask.\nFilter Location If you only have 1 HEPA/CR Box or humidifier, I think it\u0026rsquo;s best in the room with the infected person as source control and for their health.\nYou can place one outside their room to filter air that leaks out.\nOtherwise, the best room for the filter is the one that you are in. They are portable, so you can carry them around.\nExiting Don’t listen to US \u0026amp; Canadian Public Health and wait only 5 days. Best is to wait until symptoms resolve + 2 negative rapid tests on 2 days. At least wait for symptoms to resolve + negative rapid test.\nN95s, filters, open windows, isolate, humidifiers - that\u0026rsquo;s it.

Long before we had modern standards, ventilation was bad.

These make up about 30% of Ontario schools.\nAn exhaust fan is on the roof and ducts were run to every room. This creates negative pressure in the space.\nEnough air should leak in through the windows or doors to provide some outdoor air.\nThe main problems are:\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t designed for enough air to leak in. For classrooms, it\u0026rsquo;s usually 250 CFM where modern standards are closer to 500 CFM. You can\u0026rsquo;t have that much fresh air coming in from outside - it can be very cold. Ever replace the windows to make them leak less? It probably happened in the past 70 years. Now they provide even less ventilation. What can you do? always check the ventilation. There is an exhaust grille in the room - usually inside wall. Hold a tissue on a stick to make sure it\u0026rsquo;s sucked in. keep the windows open as much as possible. add filtration (HEPA filter or CR Box) If the tissue doesn\u0026rsquo;t get sucked in, alert the building operator to fix the fan.\nLong term fixes are:\ninstall unit ventilators in every room add in new ductwork and install a new HVAC unit to provide proper ventilation knock the building down and start over These \u0026ldquo;exhaust only ventilation\u0026rdquo; buildings are some of the worst when we discuss sick buildings.

Ventilation and filtration ALSO reduce transmission in close proximity. See:https://t.co/AkCxOtrWbX\n\u0026mdash; Prof. Jose-Luis Jimenez (@jljcolorado) February 24, 2022 All the In-Room mitigation methods are additive. They individually work to clean the air. Out-Of-Room methods clean the recirculated air. They aren\u0026rsquo;t as effective:\nAll methods clean the same air. Once it\u0026rsquo;s clean, more mitigation doesn\u0026rsquo;t help. Diminishing returns. If you are supplying air from one zone to another through a HVAC unit, that is long range transmission and lower risk (but still possible). If the HVAC unit supplies many zones, then the recirculated air is diluted with air from all the zones. Virus concentrations supplied to the spaces will be low. There are cases where out-of-room mitigation is completely useless, like HVAC units without recirculated air. Is it possible that heating/cooling coils or going through the unit can damage the virus anyways? If the HVAC unit supplies a single space, then improvements are similar to in-room mitigation. The larger the HVAC unit is and the more zones it supplies, improvements only protect against long range transmission. Out-Of-Room mitigation shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be completely dismissed. There are other health benefits. Bringing in more outdoor air lowers CO2 levels and improves cognition and health. MERV-13 filters remove all PM2.5 which is associated with adverse health effects.\nLong range transmission still happens and mitigation is worthwhile, but shared room transmission is higher risk and should have higher focus. For smaller HVAC units, it\u0026rsquo;s still worthwhile to use the out-of-room methods.\n","permalink":"http://www.itsairborne.com/tweets/engineering-methods/in-room-out-of-room/","summary":"Not all engineering methods to stop airborne spread are created equal.

Here\u0026rsquo;s what they look like:\nThis is a schematic of what it looks like inside. Here are the steps:\nAir is returned from the space into the unit. The exhaust damper - air leaves here. It\u0026rsquo;s usually a backdraft damper. Air can only flow out and not in. It isn\u0026rsquo;t motorized. The mixed air dampers/economizer - these control the ventilation. When they are \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo;, it means the outdoor air damper is open and the return air damper is closed. This brings in 100% outdoor air. The return damper closing forces the air out through the exhaust damper. When they are \u0026ldquo;closed\u0026rdquo; the outdoor air damper is closed and the return damper is open. 100% of the air is recirculated. No fresh air.\nFor safety, dampers always fail to the closed configuration.\nAfter the dampers, the air is a mix of return and outdoor air, it passes through a replaceable bank of filters like in your home furnace. This catches dust and prevents it from clogging up the coils or being supplied to the space.\nThe air passes through a direct expansion (DX) cooling coil. It works similar to your furnace through compression and expansion of a refrigerant. When it\u0026rsquo;s on, it cools down the air.\nThe air passes through a gas fired heating coil. When it\u0026rsquo;s on, it heats up the air.\nThe fan is what pushes the air.\nThe air is supplied back to the space.\nIf it is computerized, there are usually 5 temperature sensors:\na. Space Temp (SPT) b. Return Air Temp (RAT) c. Outdoor Air Temp (OAT) d. Mixed Air Temp (MAT) e. Supply Air Temp (SAT) How the temperatures work:\nIf dampers are closed, MAT = RAT If dampers are open, MAT = OAT If heating and cooling are off, SAT = MAT cooling on, SAT \u0026lt; MAT heating on, SAT \u0026gt; MAT SPT should be close to RAT, but due to stratification, RAT might be a bit higher.\nGeneral sequence of operations for the equipment: Fan: always runs during occupied hours at night during the winter, the space temperature is allowed to get colder. If it gets too cold, the fan will turn on to heat the space (night setback). before occupancy, the fan will turn on early to heat up the space so when people arrive, it won\u0026rsquo;t be cold. This is called optimal start or morning warmup. some places might have morning cooldown and night setback for cooling. Generally not common in Canada. Cooling: when it\u0026rsquo;s hot outside, if the space is too warm, turn on the cooling. Supply cold air to the zone until it\u0026rsquo;s satisfied.\nHeating: when it\u0026rsquo;s cold outside, if the space is too cold, turn on the heating. Supply hot air to the zone until it\u0026rsquo;s satisfied.\nDampers: when the fan is off or unoccupied (night setback or morning warmup), dampers are closed. during normal operation, dampers open to a position to provide the minimum amount of required air to the space. Free cooling/economizer mode: if it\u0026rsquo;s cooler outside than inside and the space is too hot, the dampers open even more to cool down the space. That\u0026rsquo;s the basics. When all this is computerized, it\u0026rsquo;s put on a building automation system (BAS).

Protect the equipment This is the number 1 priority. Even if it leads to cold spaces or no ventilation. If the equipment breaks, it\u0026rsquo;s useless. One example is a low limit sensor/freezestat. If there is very cold air coming from an air handling unit, it\u0026rsquo;s shut down.\nThat stops any ventilation to the building, but it prevents the heating coil from freezing, bursting and destroying the unit.\n2. Thermal Comfort (ASHRAE 55) Keeping people comfortable is essential.\nMany have advocated for compromising on thermal comfort during the pandemic so that ventilation can be improved. ASHRAE has taken a stance against this. It\u0026rsquo;s also a health issue being cold all day long.\nIf an air handling unit cannot maintain thermal comfort, ventilation must be reduced.\n3. Ventilation (ASHRAE 62.1) If equipment is safe and the occupants are comfortable, minimum air quality standards must be maintained.\n4. Energy Savings Provided the other priorities are satisfied, the goal is to minimize energy usage. Right now during the pandemic, it is reasonable to prioritize air quality over energy savings. It\u0026rsquo;s important to realize that air quality contradicts energy savings.\nBy bringing in more fresh air, you have to heat that air up. It also costs energy to move more air with a fan. This is why designs use minimum ventilation requirements. Anything more consumes more energy. It\u0026rsquo;s important to discuss what that minimum should be moving forward.\n","permalink":"http://www.itsairborne.com/tweets/ventilation/hvac-priorities/","summary":"When we control HVAC equipment, there is a balance of different goals that sometimes contradict each other.","title":"Priorities When Controlling HVAC Equipment"},{"content":"Source\nIt began an aggressive anti-HEPA filter lobbying campaign with politicians, public health officials and school boards.\nThe goal was to spread lies about HEPA filters to ensure it could infect as many kids as possible.

It makes sense to closely monitor the CO2 levels. Higher CO2 levels indicate a higher risk environment where you are more likely to get infected.\nIf you are going to a public place with other people, you want to reduce your risk as much as possible. By monitoring the CO2 levels, you get a good assessment of your risk. If you are indoors with other people, it\u0026rsquo;s best choose a place with lower CO2 levels.\nSchools You can choose a restaurant or a museum and if the ventilation is poor, go somewhere else. Kids and teachers can\u0026rsquo;t.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve previously expressed skepticism about successful implementation, but it can be helpful. Here are some uses.\nSee also: https://twitter.com/Poppendieck/status/1456461078041333760\nWindows Opening up windows is a good way to always get fresh air. There are limits if it\u0026rsquo;s cold outside. A CO2 monitor could let the teacher make decisions about opening and closing windows.\nHowever, I think people don\u0026rsquo;t realize that aside from professionals and those reading this on twitter, very few people understand CO2 levels and ventilation.\nSchool boards are still banning respirators. Would they spend time training teachers about CO2 monitoring?\nIf it works, then great, but before sending out CO2 sensors to all classrooms, school boards and teachers would need to get on board with this.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen how HEPA filters are used. They are left in the corner of the room and turned on low speed. This could be the same.\nMaintenance A parent used CO2 monitoring to identify a broken air handling unit (AHU) and get if fixed. (Can’t find the tweet)\nIt can work. But that is only if the parents are given this information and not if it is just left in a classroom.\nEquipment should be maintained properly and much of my job is trying to make this happen. Due to a historic culture, maintenance deals with complaints which originate from thermal comfort, not ventilation.\nTo be fair, maintenance is understaffed so this is expected. This isn’t just schools, it’s everywhere. People care about the heating and cooling working properly because it’s readily noticeable, but ventilation is always neglected.\nCO2 sensors drift over time or get dust on them and loose accuracy. They need calibration or replacement. If monitoring CO2 is a long term goal, it would significantly increase maintenance work. I don’t see this working.\nAlmost all school boards have a building automation system (BAS) to control the equipment. I’ve designed and installed BAS for many schools across the GTA.\nBroken AHUs can be seen remotely. High CO2 will be telling you what you should already know.\nMy kid’s school has no BAS. The roof top units that supply the ventilation were never setup properly. Here, monitoring CO2 can let you know if the dampers need to be adjusted. Any school like this would greatly benefit from CO2 monitoring. This isn\u0026rsquo;t too common.\nIMO, if the mechanical systems can already be well monitored, then there is less need for CO2 monitoring. People don\u0026rsquo;t realize that this is already the case at the major school boards.\nFor schools without this capability, then CO2 monitoring is very appropriate.\nRecess Maybe if CO2 gets too high, take the kids out for recess. IMO, we should be taking them out for recess more anyways. I\u0026rsquo;m not a teacher and don\u0026rsquo;t know if adjusting the schedules is really possible, but even without CO2 monitoring, we should be maximizing recess.\nParental Knowledge Many are learning how to protect themselves from COVID. Knowing the CO2 level in the classroom can give you piece of mind or make you worry (understandably). Schools would need to disclose. But that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily change anything.\nPolitical Will Once there is more education about poor ventilation in some schools, we can get more will from our leaders to fix it. Unfortunately, the only option is demolishing and rebuilding around 20% of schools. Easier said than done.\nEducation This is what school is about! Get the teachers and school boards on board! Teach everyone about monitoring CO2. Stay healthy with clean air, reduce risk of getting COVID.\nBut a change needs to happen in acknowledging #COVIDisAirborne, otherwise it\u0026rsquo;s a waste.\nEmpowering Teachers If there are ventilation problems, the teachers could notify the principal which might be more effective to get it fixed. Teachers would need to get on board. This wouldn\u0026rsquo;t do anything at schools with bad ventilation in the first place.\nConclusion I might have missed some possible uses. I think people with their heart in the right place want CO2 monitors in classrooms everywhere. But I believe before putting CO2 everywhere, we need to know what we will do and ensure it can be done.\nEvery school is different. There are some situations where it can be very helpful. In many situations, I\u0026rsquo;m skeptical about how beneficial it will be given the tools we already have, limitations of the building and school board acknowledgement of airborne transmission.\nSchool boards across Canada still ban respirators and HEPA filters. It’s cruel. If they can’t get that right, I’m not optimistic about CO2 monitoring.\nNow, we could offer CO2 monitors to teachers that want. If it\u0026rsquo;s just placed in every classroom, it will just be ignored.\nThis is about a societal change. People need to get on board with clean air and airborne mitigation. If no one cares about the treatment, then the diagnosis is pretty useless. Once people care, lets put CO2 monitors everywhere!\nI acknowledge I come at this from a perspective of someone who designs and commissions HVAC systems for schools and sees how it operates. I have no control over operations, so it’s made me jaded.\nI hope everything changes now.\nFinal thing. The people in charge, especially public health, have no desire to listen to anything engineers have to say. School boards blindly follow public health who are still denying #COVIDisAirborne\n","permalink":"http://www.itsairborne.com/tweets/ventilation/co2-in-schools/","summary":"When humans breathe out, 4-5% is CO2.
